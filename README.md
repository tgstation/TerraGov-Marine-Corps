"Ne participes, nec mors sequetur"
# Blackstone
Blackstone is a fantasy roleplaying game based on the source code for Roguetown, and is inspired by Table Top Roleplaying Games. The goal of Blackstone is to provide a freeform fantasy roleplay environment with minimal admin intervention, where players are empowered to collectively decide what is and is not acceptable through in-game action.
