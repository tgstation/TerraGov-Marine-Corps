    # The use of `actions/cache/restore` and `actions/cache/save` here is deliberate, as we want to
    # save the BYOND install to a cache as early as possible. If we used just `actions/cache`, it
    # would only attempt to save the cache at the end of a job. This ensures that if a workflow run
    # is cancelled, we already have a cache to restore from.
