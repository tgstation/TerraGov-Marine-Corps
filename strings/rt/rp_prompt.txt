(Welcome to Roguetown)
It is the age of abandonment
<br><br>
It is the year 1522, the world has recently seen the end of a massive conflict known as the War in the Mists between the two major nations of the world. To the west, the Zybatine Empire has grown out of the remanents of the Golden-Bridge Empire of old, its name lost to the annals of time and the greed of it sultans.
To the east, the Grenzelhofts have carved an imperiate out of the various tribes and nations of its contient, it's legions marching upon its foes with ruthless efficency to those its politicans cannot coerce with trade and political overpowering. Many claim the Gods have abandoned this world, with the hordes of beasts growing ever more present in daily life, the various wars between petty-kings over whatever remains untouched by the dominant powers and the ever amassing fervor against the arts of magic leading to what has been refered to as 'The Fallow Years'.

However, not all places are afflicted as miserably by the growing pains of a new era. Such as the place our story takes place: Rockhill. The mantlepiece of a small petty kingdom on the Isle of Enigma, this township has long since stood upon the burrows of a much more ancient and mysterious empire of old. This town is a melting pot of cultural, political and martial history, with it being a cornerstone location where adventurers and townsfolk alike congregate to share in its rather impressive wealth and quality of living compared to other borderstates.
