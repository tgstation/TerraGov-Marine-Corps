Dying is part of the game.
While holding nothing in your active hand, click a person on fire with help intent to put the fire out. This applies both xenos and humans.
You can select locations on the targeting doll in your HUD by using the number pad.
While you have your throw mode active, you can automatically catch things that are thrown at you, if you are able to hold the item as a species.
Sometimes you won't be able to avoid dying no matter how good you are at the game. Try not to stress too much about it.
When a round ends, nearly everything about it is lost forever. Leave your salt behind with it.
Some people are unable to read text on a game where half of it is based on text.
This is a game that is constantly being developed. Expect things to be added, removed, fixed, oudated and broken on a daily basis.
In maps where there is water, you can simply run to rivers or areas where there is water to extinguish yourself while on fire.
In the character setup screen, you can set your keybinds to control actions much more easily.
While alive, use 'resist' (Default: B) to stop, drop and roll when on fire. Humans can also use the resist command to struggle out of warrior grabs or to simply unbuckle from a chair.
Help Intent (Default: 1) allows you to exchange positions with another mob with their help intent active. Other intents (Disarm, Grab or Harm) will push mobs aside.
When in doubt: Adminhelp for problems with people violating the rules, Mentorhelp for questions that you want to know the answer to.
Check the SS13 Webmap to learn the layout of the ship or the map currently in play.
After you have ghosted out of the game (either from dying, cryo or manual ghost), you can respawn back into the game after waiting for 30 minutes (as a marine) or if there is a larva available (as a xenomorph).
To sing, add "%" before any text. Singing on radios will not work, but singing on intercomms will.
You can respawn during End-Of-Round Deathmatch in the OOC tab.
Sundering reduces the effectiveness of xeno armor by percentage. Some xenomorph castes can heal and decrease sunder. Resting heals sunder, but slowly.
When you want to claim a mob, claim it now! Others will claim it as soon as they are available.
You can customize your ghost using the Ghost Customization command under the Preferences tab.
As either a marine or a xeno, you will die quickly and horribly if you find yourself in a pressureless enviroment (a.k.a spess).
There are no such things as macros, only keybinds.
Communication, be it from a marine to a marine, a drone to the queen, or command to everyone, is vital and information on flanks can change how the entire round plays out.
As an alien or marine, be careful of the flank, regardless of if the push is going well or stalling out.
Half of getting good is knowing to be aggressive. The other half is knowing when not to be aggressive.
When talking, surround what you type (without the quotes) with "__", "++" or "||" to underline, bold, or italicize what you say. You combine these modifiers too!
