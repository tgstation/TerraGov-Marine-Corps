Always thank your drones and hivelords for supporting the hive!
Do not fight as a young xenomorph.
Most alien deaths are caused by over-aggression. Rein yourself in, or you may find yourself dying round after round.
If you have difficulty clicking marines, try using bump slash. You can use movement keys to slash marines. That said, clicking marines to slash them is faster than bump slashing!
It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you as a xenomorph have your abilities set up on keybinds. Ask for help if you don't know how in XOOC or mhelp.
In the xeno tab, you can use the crawl through vent verb to quickly find and use vents in the floor without having to alt-click them. You can also keybind it!
It is faster to re-fill an empty acid well than rolling on the ground to put out a fire.
Acid well extinguishes fire and explode into an acid cloud when destroyed. The queen, the shrike, praetorians, boilers, and hivelords can make acid wells.
The queen, shrike, and hivelord have access to Queen's Blessing, a menu for the hive to use psychic points to give xenomorphs a cutting edge in the battlefield.
If you have acid spit, you can spit at a welding fuel tank to blow it up. If the welding fuel is near hostiles, you might give them a pleasant surprise!
As a xeno, check hive status often.
As a xeno, you've got pheromones that can help the hive.
As a xeno, you can pounce past window frames and barricades without barbed wires.
As a xeno, pouncing into a barricade with barbed wire stuns you.
As a xeno, aging from young to mature gives you the most benefit, further aging has diminishing returns.
As a xeno, don't take too long attacking during the crash phase. The ship can be rigged to explode in twenty minutes, ending the round in a tie.
As a xeno, remember that neurotox injected by defilers, sentinels, and the Queen can overdose, killing a marine quickly. Try to avoid this when capturing, if they scream in pain they've probably had enough.
As a xeno, you can crawl through holes in walls made by acid by SpecialClicking (Default: CTRL) on them or click-dragging yourself on them. If you're too big to pass through, you'll damage the wall instead.
As a xeno, you can climb over window frames by SpecialClicking (Default: CTRL) on them or click-dragging yourself on them.
As a xeno, do not camp the landing zones prior to the marines building their defenses.
As a xeno, do not block other xenos' paths when they are retreating. Circumvent this by being on Help Intent or by simply moving away.
As a xeno, white weed helps you heal faster, green weeds slows down marines, and weed with no colors are normal weeds. Rest on the white weeds to heal faster!
As a larva, ask your hive leader what you should evolve into, if nobody responds you can check hive status and think what xenomorphs need the most.
As a larva, you can slide under unbolted and unwelded doors by clicking on the door.
As a larva, stay on weeds while growing, you will grow faster as a result.
As a runner or larva, you can pass over window frames without climbing on to them beforehand.
As a drone or sentinel, your corrosive acid is very weak, but it's better than nothing.
As a drone or hivelord, spread weeds as much as you can, especially near the front line fighters.
Before you evolve as the Hivemind as a drone, hide into a secure area! Once you evolve you be able to move anymore.
As a carrier, you can hit a host directly with a thrown facehugger to have a high chance of infecting them near instantly. This will take time, however.
As a carrier, you can hide traps beneath certain objects and items.
As a hunter, you have almost perfect stealth if you stand still.
As a hunter, you can sneak / change move intention during stealth to make it hard on marines to see you while moving in stealth.
As a ravager or the Queen, you are fire-resistant, NOT fireproof. You can still get lit on fire, but you take very little damage from it.
As a spitter, boiler, praetorian, or the Queen take advantage of unguarded barricades and defenses, melt or constantly spit acid on them if you can.
As a boiler or the Queen, you have the most powerful corrosive acid for melting things.
As the Shrike, take advantage of your psychic abilities. Use Psychic Fling and Unrelenting Force to displace a marine or even push certain and hazardous objects to your enemies and vice versa.
As the Queen, your screech does not only affect the mobs on view, but affects through walls or gases. However, the effect of the screech will be reduced.
