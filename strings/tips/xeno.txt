If you have acid spit, you can spit at a welding fuel tank to blow it up. If the welding fuel is near hostiles, you might give them a pleasant surprise!

The King has the strongest pheromones, followed by the Queen, praetorians, Hivemind, the Shrike and hivelords, defilers, and carriers. Drones have the weakest pheromones.

As a xeno, spread weeds as much as you can, especially near the front-line fighters.
Before you evolve into the Hivemind as a drone, hide in a secure area! Once you evolve, you will create a core that cannot be moved.

As a carrier, you can hide traps beneath certain objects and items.
As a hunter, you have almost perfect stealth if you stand still.

As the Shrike, take advantage of your psychic abilities. Use Psychic Fling and Unrelenting Force to displace a marine or even push certain and hazardous objects towards your enemies and vice versa.
