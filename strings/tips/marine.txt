Some weapons permit aim mode, which prevents friendly fire. Use this behind marines and be a smartgunner-lite!

The Revolver and Service Pistol can be decent primary weapons if used properly, though with the short magazine capacity, expect to run dry on ammo quick!
There is no "best" loadout. Experiment and find what works for you.
You have a variety of weaponry inside the Automated Weapon Closets, do not be afraid to experiment which one is best suited for your playstyle.

In the Crash gamemode, cooperate as a marine! Work as a squad to capture the disks and to detonate the nuclear bomb.
In the Crash gamemode, remember that your objective is to secure all three disks, put the disks into the nuclear device and head home while the bomb is active. Xenos will keep on respawning until all of the marines are dead.

If you are sure a barricade will fail and cause a breach, just make barricade behind that one, and move it forward, no need to risk your life in a breach.

The cryopods in medbay heal most types of damage but not organ damage!
When in doubt, throw them in the autodoc.
Medbay may sometimes run out of power. To avoid this, scream at your nearest engineer to repair the fusion reactors or replace the power cell in medbay's APC.
