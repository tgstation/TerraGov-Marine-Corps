As a human, you can do almost anything if you put your mind to it; it just takes time.
While medics and doctors are best at it, anyone can use a defibrillator and operate the body scanner and autodoc medical system.
Anyone can make razor wire with four metal rods and barbed wire from metal sheets.
Using a multitool on a lasgun battery will turn it into an improvised explosive with a random timer.
In a pinch, you can use lasgun batteries to power APCs and sentry guns.
Lasgun batteries can be recharged in APCs and power cell rechargers, if the generators are on.
As a marine, if you aren't a PFC, then you have a special room in prep with special gear vendors.
Sidearms aren't complete garbage. They are often faster than reloading if in a very tight situation, it may save your life. 
The Revolver and Service Pistol can be decent primary weapons if used properly, though with the short magazine capacity, expect to run dry on ammo quick!
There is no "best" loadout. Experiment and find what works for you.
You have a variety of weaponry inside the Automated Weapon Closets, do not be afraid to experiment which one is best suited for your playstyle.
There are "specialist" weaponry that can be ordered by Requisitions. However, they take quite an fairly high amount to order them, what's more, if the user dies irresponsibly while using these weapons themselves, it will be a massive waste of points.
Anything can be a weapon if you put your mind to it.
You can check your wounds to see if they have been bandaged or salved by clicking on yourself while in help intent.
You can check what part of your body is bleeding by shift-clicking on your person.
Removing weeds as a marine means you can move faster and that xenomorphs cannot take advantages of weeds; your standard boot knife is great for doing this.
During Self Destruct, green control rods are armed control rods; collect all six!
A fit marine can carry many weapons: in their armor, belt, even hanging from their back.
Requisitions have many supplies to enhance the combat power of marine units, such as attachments, ammunition, and other toys; ask their crew what's on store and you may be pleasantly surprised. DISCLAIMER: Extra gear's availability is dependent on supply.
Cargo points are valuable: Some crates, like SL armour, standard weaponry or attachments, may be a waste of points which could be better spent on other stuff. 
As a human, you can climb over waist-high obstacles like sandbags, window frames or tables by "SpecialClicking" (Default: CTRL) on them or drag-clicking yourself on them.
The TX-73 Lasrifle has a mode selector that can be switched using the Unique Action command (Default: Spacebar). Some modes are better than other modes in specific circumstances.
You can remove armor pieces (leg pieces, arm pieces and chest pieces) and armor modules (Valkyrie, Baldur, etc.) from the XM-02 Combat Exoskeleton using the crowbar and screwdriver espectively.
You can customize armor pieces and the exoskeleton helmet using any kind of facepaint for a personal touch.

SWAT masks ordered from Requisitions can block only one facehugger attack, if they successfully blocked an attempted attack, replace them immediately.
Drag crates of platinum and phoron to the Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) pad inside cargo. Once the pad lowers with the applicable crates, you will gain requisition points. This applies to dead xenomorphs as well!
In snow maps (such as Ice Colony or Icey Caves), wear a coif or scarf! You will freeze to death if you go outside of your dropship if you are not wearing them!
To throw a grenade, Activate (Default: Z) the grenade while in the active hand. You will then automatically enter throw mode, in which then you can simply click anywhere to throw it. Do not take too long!
Quickly store items to the container (bags, satchels, belts, pouches) by pressing the Quick Equip (Default: E) key while holding an item and you are looking at a container.
Press Quick Equip (Default: E) while you are not holding an item to the active hand to draw the weapon from whatever preferred slot (Default: Suit Storage, can be customized at the Preferences tab) you selected, otherwise you will pull out any item from a container.
When captured by the xenomorphs, infected and you think you are not going to make it out alive, use a pocket pistol on yourself to prevent the chestburster from popping out. A dead marine is better than a popped marine.
Stasis bags do not pause xenomorph infection entirely, they only slow progress by a lot.
In the Crash gamemode, cooperate as a marine! Work as a squad to capture the disks and to detonate the nuclear bomb.
In the Crash gamemode, remember that your objective is to secure all three disks, put the disk into the nuclear device and head home while the bomb is active. Xenos will keep on respawning until all of the marines are dead.
While securing a FOB or securing the disk site, do not wander around outside! You will risk death by xenos who are comfy in sieging down the place.
As an ERT member, stay with your teammates! Don't cower or seperate apart from them.

As a human, when you are already infected, facehuggers will ignore you. But you still need medical attention later regardless.
As a human, please try not to aim for the head. It benefits more for the xenomorphs as they will not take more damage on the head and when you commit friendly-fire to someone, you might break their head instead. Aim for the center of mass!
Not being ready at the start of the round means xenos get more burrowed larva, and that you don't get to play as quickly.

As a squad marine, you can take two two-handed guns, one in the suit slot and one on your back.

As a corpsman or engineer, your number one priority is NOT hunting down xenomorphs! Leave it to the combat marines. You have more essential, and important tasks at hand.
As a doctor, the cryotubes are excellent at dealing with basic damage.
As a doctor, the cryotubes heal internal bleeding and organ damage, although slowly.
As a doctor, surgery time from fastest to slowest is: by hand, Autodoc manual, Autodoc automatic.
As a doctor, the white vest fits on your scrubs and can hold surgical tools.

As an engineer, you can repair barricades with a welder.
As an engineer, C4 is cheaper but det packs are more versatile.
As an engineer, det packs can be set on demolition mode for an explosive trap.
As an engineer, you build barricades the fastest.
As an engineer, repair the mining wells. These mining machines will mine phoron or platinum that can be used for requisitions, earning them more points!
As an engineer, placing turrets on open spaces and without defenses is a poor choice.
As a corpsman, the medevac stretcher needs to be linked to an active, powered beacon for it to teleport the patient.
As a corpsman, the marines are counting on you to fix them up.
As a corpsman, scan before you treat and you can't be beat.
As a corpsman or doctor, remember that your HUD will tell you how much time is left to defibrillate a patient. From highest to lowest: Green, orange and red.
As a corpsman, remember to bring extra kelotane or dermaline to heal burn damage. Xenos love acid and burning marines.
As a corpsman, hypervene is useful. Use it to purge deadly neurotoxins and larva boosting growth hormones.
The B18 armor from Requisitions has an built-in medical system. The Valkyrie Automedical Armor System can do the same for the XM-02 Combat Exoskeleton.
The V1 tarp (available from Requisitions) can be stealted once you covered yourself with it.
The TL-84 flamethrower has an inbuilt fire extinguisher as an attachment.
As the PO, pay attention to the radio! Who knows if someone needs immediate surgery or evacuation until their fate becomes worse?
As the Captain, you have a unique Mateba revolver that takes a chunk of a target's healthpool down. However, you are important for completing the mission, so do not participate in active combat using the Mateba!
Even if a patient dies a second after being successfully revived by a defibrillator, this resets the time it takes for them to become permanently brain dead.
Don't forget that xenomorphs spawn infinitely during the Crash gamemode. Don't waste too much time hunting xenomorphs down!
You can memorialize fallen marines by using their dogtags on the ship's memorial! Memorialized solders will be displayed at the end of the round.
