While medics and doctors are best at it, anyone can use a defibrillator and operate the body scanner and autodoc medical system.
Anyone can make razor wire with four metal rods and barbed wire from metal sheets.
Using a multitool on a lasgun battery will turn it into an improvised explosive with a random timer.
In a pinch, you can use lasgun batteries to power APCs and sentry guns.
Lasgun batteries can be recharged in APCs and power cell rechargers, if the generators are on.
As a marine, if you aren't a PFC, then you have a special room in prep with special gear vendors.
Sidearms aren't complete garbage. They are often faster than reloading if in a very tight situation, it may save your life.
The Revolver and Service Pistol can be decent primary weapons if used properly, though with the short magazine capacity, expect to run dry on ammo quick!
There is no "best" loadout. Experiment and find what works for you.
You have a variety of weaponry inside the Automated Weapon Closets, do not be afraid to experiment which one is best suited for your playstyle.
There are "specialist" weaponry that can be ordered by Requisitions. However, they take quite an fairly high amount to order them, what's more, if the user dies irresponsibly while using these weapons themselves, it will be a massive waste of points.
Anything can be a weapon if you put your mind to it.
You can check your wounds to see if they have been bandaged or salved by clicking on yourself while in help intent.
You can check what part of your body is bleeding by shift-clicking on your person.
Removing weeds as a marine means you can move faster and that xenomorphs cannot take advantages of weeds; your standard boot knife is great for doing this.
During Self Destruct, green control rods are armed control rods; collect all six!
A fit marine can carry many weapons: in their armor, belt, even hanging from their back.
Requisitions have many supplies to enhance the combat power of marine units, such as attachments, ammunition, and other toys; ask their crew what's on store and you may be pleasantly surprised. DISCLAIMER: Extra gear's availability is dependent on supply.

SWAT masks ordered from Requisitions can block only one facehugger attack, if they successfully blocked an attempted attack, replace them immediately.
Drag crates of platinum and phoron to the Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) pad inside cargo. Once the pad lowers with the applicable crates, you will gain requisition points. This applies to dead xenomorphs as well!
In snow maps (such as Ice Colony or Icey Caves), wear a coif or scarf! You will freeze to death if you go outside of your dropship if you are not wearing them!
To throw a grenade, Activate (Default: Z) the grenade while in the active hand. You will then automatically enter throw mode, in which then you can simply click anywhere to throw it. Do not take too long!

When captured by the xenomorphs, infected and you think you are not going to make it out alive, use a pocket pistol on yourself to prevent the chestburster from popping out. A dead marine is better than a popped marine.
Stasis bags do not pause xenomorph infection entirely, they only slow progress by a lot.
In the Crash gamemode, cooperate as a marine! Work as a squad to capture the disks and to detonate the nuclear bomb.
In the Crash gamemode, remember that your objective is to secure all three disks, put the disk into the nuclear device and head home while the bomb is active. Xenos will keep on respawning until all of the marines are dead.

As a human, when you are already infected, facehuggers will ignore you. But you still need medical attention later regardless.
As a human, please try not to aim for the head. It benefits more for the xenomorphs as they will not take more damage on the head and when you commit friendly-fire to someone, you might break their head instead. Aim for the center of mass!
Not being ready at the start of the round means xenos get more burrowed larva, and that you don't get to play as quickly.

As the PO, pay attention to the radio! Who knows if someone needs immediate surgery or evacuation until their fate becomes worse?
As the Captain, you have a unique Mateba revolver that takes a chunk of a target's healthpool down. However, you are important for completing the mission, so do not participate in active combat using the Mateba!
Even if a patient dies a second after being successfully revived by a defibrillator, this resets the time it takes for them to become permanently brain dead.
