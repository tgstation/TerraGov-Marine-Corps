{"Contents":["<p><strong><em>By Hunlaf, Gravedigger. Revised by Lenore, Priest of Necra.</em></strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am no poet. I am no writer. I am not learned in many things, but I put my knowledge of burying the dead to paper so that future followers of the Grave-Daughter may appease her as I have these many yils. Many would scoff at my attempts in this endeavor, but it shall be men like me who prepare their bodies when Necra rings her bell.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To begin, one must have the tools needed to properly dig into the soil. A shovel is the badge of office for gravedigging; for it scoops the earth enough to fit a man&apos;s body inside. Next is to prepare the body for it&apos;s passage to the beyond, so one must place the body inside of the pit that has been dug. The digger must then cover the hole (and by extension, the body) with clods of dirt once more; and then fashion a Pantheon&apos;s Cross with sticks atop the grave so that the soul may pass our world.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With these simple steps, the Grave-Daughter is pleased and the soul is protected from the evils of Zizo. Below shall be added steps for those willing to pay for more favorable send-offs unto the next:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One may wish to have a shawl to cover their corpses from prying eyes; these things are to be placed below the deceased before the body is covered with clods. It is considered a nicety for those who were valued by society.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A coin is often buried with the dead as a sign good fortune, to pay for the Carriageman&apos;s services.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sermons are a good way to collect dues from friends and loved ones of the deceased, as well as tell stories of their life. One might be inclined for them to speak on behalf of the dead so that the Undermaiden&apos;s judgement might be swayed...</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Corpses that are not buried often rise due to the curse of Zizo, and as such it is a gravedigger&apos;s duty to be expedient with their duties.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The dead do not like to be disturbed. While treasures are often in graves, they are guarded by more than just the faithful of the Grave-Daughter...</p>
