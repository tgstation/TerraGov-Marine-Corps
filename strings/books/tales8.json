<p><br></p>
<p>For weeks has the empire ship I have been onboard of been trailing behind a brigantine, whose sails reflected a blue mirage</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I questioned a few sailors about said ship, their response raised more questions then awnsers:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;whalers&quot; they said, &quot;Hired by the capitan for safe passage to the island&quot; a few hushed their voices &quot;A legend commands them, great storm beasts felled in fair trials&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I managed to ask the first mate about it during our breakfast, our only heated meal of the day, about the sails and the whalers</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&quot;Whalers, seguidores de Abyssor, strong cabrones, capitan even more so, mataron-killed a storm daughter and made a sail out of it&apos;s feathers&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Tonight i shall ask the capitan about allowing me to board the ship</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[Wedding&apos;s dae]</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe a grave mistake has been made, the capitan questioned me multiple times if I was sure</p>
<p>He told me that, i&apos;d be in a raft to be picked up by the brigantine as they had to give them extra supplies as both a tithe and a guarantee I would not be thrown overboard, he handed me a sealed letter to give to the capitan and made me wait in my quarters, as they prepared everything, I saw the ship comming closer and as it did, the seas shook in fury, we had calm seas and favorable winds all this time, something is amiss, i feel it</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An elder humen named Cordelia helped me out of the small raft and helped me walk in the storage of the ship, the smell of oil and iron is abundant in this place, she chuckled, saying that this was both a graveyard and a temple, I presented myself</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I questioned her about the &quot;whales&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&quot;Great se&apos; creatures of Abyssor, cha &apos;ont wanna f&apos;te them&quot; she smiled, pointing torwards the walls of the ship runes, efigies and sigils were carved or &quot;charms, prayers, offerings, t&apos; tha wind&apos; &apos;nd waters&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&quot;Whales, Abyssor&apos;s child&apos;, not all the same, not all swim, sons of th&apos; se&apos;s made like those who dive &apos;nd swim, &apos;nd those who com&apos; with the storm&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>She led me up a staircase, and opened a door, the rays of sunlight hit my eyes and i saw the men of the ship, they had tatoos, scars, long loose aparel, hooks and charms, weapons, they looked all ready for war, unlike the men of the empire who were all uniformed and well dressed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Cordelia pointed towards the mast, the bright iridecent blue light being reflected from it as the wind pushed onto it</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&quot;It cam&apos; with the storms, &apos;nd it m&apos;rdered our wind&apos;, with &apos;ach moment, the &apos;lbatross got clos&apos;r, it swooped across th&apos; deck, t&apos;king one of th&apos; crew and singing &apos;ts horrid song&quot; she kept telling her story, her eyes with cataracts almost white, looking at the deck as if she was seing it all occur infront of her once again &quot;she sang, as &apos;ach crewmate was devoured, unt&apos;l on&apos; of h&apos;r swoops was met by the c&apos;ptan&apos;s harpoon, h&apos;r single eye was blinded, &apos;nd crashed ont&apos; our deck, by th&apos;t time, we all w&apos;nted to make h&apos;r pay&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>She smiled, showing off missing teeth, but the lovable smile of a grandparent</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&quot;Well, she mad&apos; for a great sail aft&apos;r all&quot;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I took a deep breath, realising I had only scratched the shores of all the stories that these whalers follow, praising abyssor and following all his creed</p>
