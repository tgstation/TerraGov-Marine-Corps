{"Contents":["Title: Reading For Robbersâ€‹

Author: Flavius of Dendor

If you are reading this, you are either a literate highwayman or an unfortunate soul reading this at knifepoint. Either way, teach the nose-picking nimrods before you what is in this book and teach them well. With the use of this book, they will learn the letters, through associations with words commonly used by bandits. After that, they can begin practicing reading.



A - Arse; B - Bandit; C - Comfrey; D - Drunk; E - Earl; F - Fuck; G - Gold; H - Hammer; I - Intelligent; J - Jizz; K - Knight; L - Lord; M - Mammon; N - Nimrod; O - Oil; P - Penis; Q - Quarter; R - Railing; S - Shit; T - Trap; 

U - Unclefucker; V - Volf; W - Wart; X - Xylix; Y - Yesteryear; Z - Zatch.



Now practice these until they are able to recognize the letters. After that, you can begin reading. Below are some sentences to practice with.



1. That oily fuck took my boots, I am going to fucking kill him. 

2. I could go for a piss.

3. Who took my fucking flail?

4. HALT! These are MY woods. Pay the toll!

5. I think that whore gave me the clap.

6. This ale tastes like piss. 

7. I don't give a rat's arse if you starve, give me the gold. 

8. Watch your step, I left my mantrap nearby.

9. I've fought nuns tougher than you!

10. Bert has been down all morning, Martub the Raper used him as a rag last night.



Keep practicing, use other books for practice, if these get stale. Soon, the drooling mongrels before you will no longer be the same drooling mongrels they were, they will still drool and they will still be mongrels, but at least they can read.
