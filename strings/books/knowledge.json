"The human form, a study of the human body, was graced with a robust anatomy. Sturdy bones and sinewy muscles formed the foundation of the human body, bestowing upon them the strength to toil and endure the of tasks of hard labor. With their bodies attuned to the demands of the grim world, humans are well-suited for laborious tasks, the wielding of weapons, and the traversing of rugged landscapes.

In contrast, the elves, forged by Dendor and forest realms, bore a markedly different physique. Their anatomy, a masterpiece of grace, was characterized by slender limbs, supple joints, and a frame of elegance. Hollow bones, like the boughs of ancient trees, lent them an otherworldly lightness that allowed for super agility and nimbleness. It was said that elves' anatomical harmony with their natural surroundings extended even to their keen senses, with eyes that could pierce the deepest of shadows and ears attuned to the faintest of forest whispers."]}
