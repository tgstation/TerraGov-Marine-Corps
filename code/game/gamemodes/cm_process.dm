Like with cm_initialize.dm, these procs exist to quickly populate classic CM game modes.
Specifically for processing, announcing completion, and so on. Simply plug in these procs
in to the appropriate slots, like the in the example game modes, and you're good to go.
This is meant for infestation type game modes for right now (marines vs. aliens, with a chance
of predators), but can be added to include variant game modes (like humans vs. humans).
