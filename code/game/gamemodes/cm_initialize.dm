/*
This is a collection of procs related to CM and spawning aliens/predators/survivors. With this centralized system,
you can spawn them at round start in any game mode. You can also add additional categories, and they will be supported
at round start with no conflict. Individual game modes may override these settings to have their own unique
spawns for the various factions. It's also a bit more robust with some added parameters. For example, if xeno_required_num
is 0, you don't need aliens at the start of the game. If aliens are required for win conditions, tick it to 1 or more.

This is a basic outline of how things should function in code.
You can see a working example in the TerraGov Marine Corps game mode.

	//Minds are not transferred/made at this point, so we have to check for them so we don't double dip.
	can_start() //This should have the following in order:
		initialize_special_clamps()
		initialize_starting_predator_list()
		if(!initialize_starting_xenomorph_list()) //If we don't have the right amount of xenos, we can't start.
			return
		initialize_starting_survivor_list()

		return 1

	pre_setup()
		//Other things can take place, such as game mode specific setups.

		return 1

	post_setup()
		initialize_post_xenomorph_list()
		initialize_post_survivor_list()
		initialize_post_predator_list()

		return 1


//Flags defined in setup.dm
