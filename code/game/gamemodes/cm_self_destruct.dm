/*
How this works:

First: All of the linking is done automatically on world start, so nothing needs to be done on that end other than making
sure that objects are actually placed in the game world. If not, the game will error and let you know about it. But you
don't need to modify variables or worry about area placement. It's all done for you.
The rods, for example, configure the time per activation based on their number. Shuttles link their own machines via area.
Nothing in this controller is linked to game mode, so it's stand alone, more or less, but it's best used during a game mode.
Admins have a lot of tools in their disposal via the check antagonist panel, and devs can access the VV of this controller
through that panel.

Second: The communication console handles most of the IC triggers for activating these functions, the rest is handled elsewhere.
Check communications.dm for that. shuttle_controller.dm handles the set up for the escape pods. escape_pods.dm handles most of the
functions of the escape pods themselves. This file would likely need to be broken down into individual parts at some point in the
future.

Evacuation takes place when sufficient alert level is reaised and a distress beacon was launched. All of the evac pods come online
and open their doors to allow entry inside. Characters may then get inside of the cryo units to before the shuttles automatically launch.
If wanted, a nearby controller object may launch each individual shuttle early. Only three people may ride on a shuttle to escape,
otherwise the launch will fail and the shuttle will become inoperable.
Any launched shuttles are taken out of the game. If the evacuation is canceled, any persons inside of the cryo tubes will be ejected.
They may temporarily open the door to exit if they are stuck inside after evac is canceled.

When the self destruct is enabled, the console comes online. This usually happens during an evacuation. Once the console is
interacted with, it fires up the self-destruct sequence. Several rods rise and must be interacted with in order to arm the system.
Once that happens, the console must be interacted with again to trigger the self destruct. The self destruct may also be
canceled from the console.

The self destruct may also happen if a nuke is detonated on the ship's zlevel; if it is detonated elsewhere, the ship will not blow up.
Regardless of where it's detonated, or how, a successful detonation will end the round or automatically restart the game.

All of the necessary difines are stored under mode.dm in defines.
