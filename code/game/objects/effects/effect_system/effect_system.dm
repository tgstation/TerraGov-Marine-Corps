/* This is an attempt to make some easily reusable "particle" type effect, to stop the code
constantly having to be rewritten. An item like the jetpack that uses the ion_trail_follow system, just has one
defined, then set up when it is created with New(). Then this same system can just be reused each time
it needs to create more trails.A beaker could have a steam_trail_follow system set up, then the steam
would spawn and follow the beaker, even if it is carried or thrown.

//Usage: set_up(number of bits of steam, use North/South/East/West only, spawn location)
// The attach(atom/atom) proc is optional, and can be called to attach the effect
// to something, like a smoking beaker, so then you can just call start() and the steam
// will always spawn at the items location, even if it's moved.

// var/datum/effect_system/steam_spread/steam = new /datum/effect_system/steam_spread() -- creates new system
steam.set_up(5, 0, mob.loc) -- sets up variables
OPTIONAL: steam.attach(mob)
steam.start() -- spawns the effect
