		It allows the user to travel very short distances through bluespace, which had previously been considering impossible to do without near certain risk of death \
		due to the inherent instability associated with such bluespace drives of this size. <br> <br>\
		While the blink drive appears to be the most accurate bluespace drive of this size yet seen, there are still dramatic risks associated with its use. <br> \
		Multiple reported instances of user displacing themselves into solid walls or other obstacles resulting in their instant death testifies to the enduring risks of such technology.<br>\
		The SOM however, appear to have no shortage of volunteers ready to accept such risks in the name of their cause. <br>"

	traits += "<U>Range:</U><br>The blink drive can teleport the user up to [BLINK_DRIVE_RANGE] tiles away, by middle clicking with the drive active. Line of Sight is not required to teleport.<br>"

	traits += "<U>Instability:</U><br>The blink drive is inherently unstable, and pushing it to its limits results in instability.<br> \
	Instability results in the user potentially teleporting to a tile near, but not exactly where they intended. <br>\
	There are three causes of instability, each level of instability means you can end up one tile away from where you click, up to a maximum of 3 tiles away.<br> \
	1. Distance: Teleporting more than [BLINK_DRIVE_RANGE - 2] tiles away <br> \
	2. Visibility: Teleporting to a tile you cannot directly see <br> \
	3. Rapid use: Using the drive less than one second after its last use <br>"

	traits += "<U>Risks:</U><br>Teleporting into a solid turf such as a wall will <U>instantly gib the user</U>.<br>\
	Great caution is advised when using the drive near solid turfs, especially when factoring in instability.<br>"

	traits += "<U>Charging:</U><br>The blink drive can store up to three charges, and recharges one every [BLINK_DRIVE_CHARGE_TIME * 0.1] seconds. It cannot recharge while in use.<br>"

	traits += "<U>AOE effect:</U><br>When the drive is used, any mob (including the user) in a small area of effect suffers from a very brief period of stagger and slowdown.<br>\
