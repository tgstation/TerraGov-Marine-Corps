At 7:30 AM on March 8th, 2017, ArcLumin died in a fatal car crash on impact.
Rest in peace, man. You did good work.
On the 6th of November, 2018 at the age of 22,
a  friend, contributor and member of our community,Austin "Valmoric" Philips passed away in his sleep
When a contributor for SS13 dies, all codebases feel it and suffer.
We may disagree on whether farts should be a thing, or what color to paint the bikeshed,
but we are all contributors together.
Goodbye, man. We'll miss you.
This memorial has been designed for him and any future contributors to perish.
