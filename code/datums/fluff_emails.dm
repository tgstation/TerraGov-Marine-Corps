	title = "RE: I want out.."

	entry_text = {"<html>
					Okay, yep, I know what you're saying. Stilettos aren't safe, you want out of my sharp stick business,
					and sooner or later we're going to get hung upside down from our ankles by the MPs, stuffed in a freezer
					in the lower decks, and tossed to the nearest military tribunal in a sack in six to eight weeks.
					Maybe that reserve grunt in Echo Company just about gutted himself with one of our blades in his bunk,
					and maybe one of them accidently got flashed in front of one of the officers during a 'disagreement',
					but neither of those things are 'explicitly' OUR faults. I know you could just as easily fashion your
					metalworking equipment towards making canteens for PFC Marshall's little business, or helping those jackass
					flyboys spruce up their tin cans, but you need to realize we occupy a market nobody else on the ship is filling.
					We'll talk about it when we're next woken for shore leave in a month, but I personally think you're making a huge
					mistake trying to opt out. I know a dozen men in the battalion who claim your stilettos pulled them out of trouble.
					Doesn't matter if they're being used to open MREs in a jam, or save one of our guys from some yokel colonist
					with a carving knife, we're doing more than just lining our pockets- we're doing a service for the men of the corps.
					<br>
					Keep that in mind.

/datum/fluff_email/mainship/thermalcloak
	title = "M68 Thermal Cloak.."
	entry_text = {"<html>
					Are you sure these things are safe, man? I just tried one on during a training exercise back at Bernice 378, took a wrong turn,
					and wound up on an outdoor firing range being used by another Battalion (5th "Hammerheads" I think?). Now typically, somebody would have spotted me,
					the range officer would have called for a ceasefire, the captain gives me a slap on the wrist, and I claim 'emotional trauma' and get served warm cookies
					and milk by the base psychiatrist. But this time, they kept firing their howling pulse rifles downrange even with me there. I hit the turf the moment
					I realized what was happening, but the rounds kept screaming overhead. My armor got snagged in the thermal cloak (couldn't get the damn thing free),
					so I had to roll myself sideways until I was clear. Turns out later I cracked a rib (didn't realize it from all the adrenaline I was pumping at the time),
					and bruised my skin so badly it turned purple. I get these cloaks are supposed to keep us concealed, but what about the rounds from our own guys?
					If you'd ask me what I was afraid of more, a squad of our own guys or the entire insurrection on Linna 349, I've since changed my answer.

/datum/fluff_email/mainship/snow
	title = "Snow? Where the hell is all the snow?"
	entry_text = {"<html>
					Why were we issued these damn snow uniforms in the first place? We've been around the sector almost three dozen times and we've
					yet to put them to use. They even issued us bulky kits to repaint our rifles, pistols and shotguns to match the cold weather gear,
					and masks to keep us warm. But what's the point? They're just taking up a fourth of the cargo hold, half infested with moths we picked
					up six months ago from Bernice 378 (that base is a sanitation nightmare), and they need to be steamed on a regular basis.
					For all the effort it's been worth to me, the moment the "Falling Falcons" have the misfortune of falling on what is probably
					the last ice planet in the galaxy, I'm making sure we stay there for another two cycles.

/datum/fluff_email/mainship/hawaianpizza
	title = "Hawaiian Pizza in the MREs?"
	entry_text = {"<html>
					I swear this must have been a joke, but the other day I opened up my MRE packet to come face to face with a 'Hawaiian Pizza" packet.
					Of course, I had already cut the seal open (otherwise I'd have fenced it to the Damien twins from Bravo Squad and have retired by now),
					but the smell was horrendous! I guess pineapple just doesn't stow well. I neglected to check the date, but it must have been an old issue,
					otherwise we'd have seen one by now. Either that, or those chinophiles in Task Force Eridani and those prissy boys in Task Force Sol haven't
					been sharing the full menu with us Task Force Herculis folks.
					<br>
					<br>
					PS: The supply sergeant's grandparents are from Naples. Don't let him hear about this or he'll be sure to cause a big fuss.
					Last time he went on a personal crusade on behalf of the entire battalion, those pricks over at central started supplying
					the ship's store-rooms with only the 'Meatloaf' flavored MRE for months. I can still taste the stuff it in my mouth I think..

/datum/fluff_email/mainship/themajor
	title = "The Major?"
	entry_text = {"<html>
					I keep forgetting what the new Major's name is. I got quizzed by one of the jackass staff officers last week about the captain's name,
					and I absolutely spilled my marbles. PCF Mable was watching too, and she probably thinks I've got rocks in my head. I know it's been weeks
					since the new captain took over, but for some reason the name keeps escaping me when it matters. Either the cryo-sleepers are juicing my
					memory capacity or the CO keeps changing their name and not telling anybody. Maybe next jump I'll scrawl it on a sticky note and plaster it
					to the inside of my sleeper pod. I can't be the only one having this problem.
