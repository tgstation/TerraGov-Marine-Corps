// Mutable appearances are an inbuilt byond datastructure. Read the documentation on them by hitting F1 in DM.
// Basically use them instead of images for overlays/underlays and when changing an object's appearance if you're doing so with any regularity.
// Unless you need the overlay/underlay to have a different direction than the base object. Then you have to use an image due to a bug.

// Mutable appearances are children of images, just so you know.

// Mutable appearances erase template vars on new, because they accept an appearance to copy as an arg
// If we have nothin to copy, we set the float plane

/** Helper similar to image()
 *
 * icon - Our appearance's icon
 * icon_state - Our appearance's icon state
 * layer - Our appearance's layer
 * atom/offset_spokesman - An atom to use as reference for the z position of this appearance.
 * 	Only required if a plane is passed in. If this is not passed in we accept offset_const as a substitute
 * plane - The plane to use for the appearance. If this is not FLOAT_PLANE we require context for the offset to use
 * alpha - Our appearance's alpha
 * appearance_flags - Our appearance's appearance_flags
 * offset_const - A constant to offset our plane by, so it renders on the right "z layer"
