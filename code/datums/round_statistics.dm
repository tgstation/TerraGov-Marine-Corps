To add new statistics, include "var/the_thing_to_count = 0" in the list below indented accordingly.

Then, in the file where the thing you want to count happens, include "round_statistics.the_thing_to_count++"

to use said count anywhere else include round_statistics.the_thing_to_count in your code.
add [] around this to use it in text.
