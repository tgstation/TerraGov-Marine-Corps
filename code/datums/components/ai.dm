/*
AI CONTROLLER COMPONENT

Really just here to exist as a way to hold the ai behavior while being an easy way of applying ai to atom/movables
The main purpose of this is to handle cleanup and setting up the initial ai behavior
*/

/**
 * An absolute hardcap on the # of instances of /datum/component/ai_controller that can exist.
 * Should a ai component get initialized while there's already enough instances of said thing, it will deny the initialization of the component but NOT the mob it's being attached to.
 * This is mainly here because admins keep on spamming AI without caring for the server's ability to handle hundreds/thousands of AI.
