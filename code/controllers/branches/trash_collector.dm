	This is the main trash collector that should be collecting, sorting, and then deleting information.
	The majority of the deletion process will come from the BYOND built-in garbage collector, but for
	cases where the garbage collector is unable to scrub the atom/datum with soft deletion, this will
	hard delete it instead. The end goal is to eliminate the need for hard deletion completely, so
	that lag is minimal due to Del() being run constantly.

	The other part of this is the atom_recycler.dm which, instead of being deleted through this process
	goes back into a list for further use. This is preferable to constantly creating and deleting atoms
	since we can just take an existing, but unused atom, and use it instead.

	This system is inspired by, and in part taken from, Ter13's pooling libraries as well as the /vg/ / bay
	and /tg/ station systems that serve a similar function. Honestly, not too different from them because
	you can't do much to innovate here. Works exactly the same way as those systems, somewhere in between
	complexity of /vg/ and /tg/, but with different names. I prefer the naming structure of an actual
	garbage collection authority, and that is reflected here.

	If I ever do a master controller, it would be called the governing authority. ~N

Individual atoms will need to modify this proc and call ..() after. Null all references to other atoms before getting rid of it.
This makes sure the BYOND garbage collector does its job properly. As mentioned in the atoms.dm, these procs should always
. = ..() so that the right directive is returned unless you manually override it with a different return. Even though the
default action is to add to queue, you may want to hard delete instead. Like the case with turfs. You don't need to call
cdel on anything in contents, like gun attachments. They are automtically cdel'd, so just null references instead and do
anything additional that may be required.
You will find the individual Destroy() calls in the various /atom  /atom/movable /obj /turf /mob files.

Override exists for any specific behavior you may want to happen. For example, you may want to force delete something instead
of adding it queue in some circumstances but not others.

TO DO: Implement more support for /mob.
