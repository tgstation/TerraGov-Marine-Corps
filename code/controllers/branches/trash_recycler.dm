/*
This is what you call on instead of new() for certain things. rnew stands for Re-New and will do a few things
for you. First, it will attempt to find the fetch_type from a list of pooled items (the recycling list).
The directive is an argument list you pass on to the datum in order to actually get an item exactly to your
specifications. If it's not a list, it should be the location where the item will spawn. If it's not a location,
the list must have the location as the first argument. The list is really only useful for things like images
that have several arguments in terms of creating their stuff.

If it can't find whatever it is you are trying to get, it'll just new() it with the list of arguments. Since we
don't specifically know what to return, we'll be using . = whatever a lot.

Calling on new() is faster, obviously, if the item doesn't exist in the recycle list since there is no overhead.
But as things are stored and called on this becomes more and more useful.

Do NOT call this through RecycleTrash(). The idea is to use qdel() instead, and the atom/whatever should return
a TA_REVIVE_ME through Destroy(), telling the Trash Authority to send the object to the recycler instead of
adding it to the trash queue. This gives the object time to null any references and such, and its location will
be nulled so it doesn't appear anywhere. Once it's added to the recycle list, it won't be deleted because the
list will reference it. Even if it's somehow deleted in the interim, it doesn't honestly matter too much.

This is the opposite of Dispose. You can override this proc for certain things if you want to preserve
specific variables about it. For example, if you have a variable that should not be initial()'ed, you
can return it with Recycle(). You can make it a list of vars too, such as list("var1","var2",...) etc.
You can also just return a single variable, it won't make a difference. If the variable is a list, you don't
need to return the whole list, just the variable name. Lists are reset to = list().

Unless you know what you are doing, you can probably leave this as it is and not bother. However, if you do
reset a bunch of referencing with Destroy(), you can pass those through so they aren't checked along with
the other vars that are read only or somesuch.
You can also return the entire list of variables if you reset them manually. Not sure why you'd want to do that though.

/*Generic image parent for any reusable image that works with the recycler.
Set up on new() as an overlay. layer and dir can be overriden, the other
stuff is required for it to show up in the first place. Anything generated
with image() sets the arguments without needing to actually set them through
New(), just like loc works for regular atoms (always set as first argument).

This means that by having overrides in New(), the proc will write everything
twice on image(). This same behavior also applies to new. When the image is
recycled, it will NOT autoset the arguments, so you have to set them through
New() instead. I thought about having a unique proc insted of using New(), to
cut down on overhead, but I think having uniform behavior is best here as the
overhead only applies when the image is first created.*/
