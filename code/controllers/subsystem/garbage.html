<p>In order to debug <code>qdel()</code> failures, there are several tools available.
To enable these tools, define <code>TESTING</code> and 'REFERENCE_TRACKING' in <a href="https://github.com/tgstation/TerraGov-Marine-Corps/blob/master/code/_compile_options.dm">_compile_options.dm</a>.</p>
<p>First is a verb called &quot;Find References&quot;, which lists <strong>every</strong> refererence to an object in the world. This allows you to track down any indirect or obfuscated references that you might have missed.</p>
<p>Complementing this is another verb, &quot;qdel() then Find References&quot;.
This does exactly what you'd expect; it calls <code>qdel()</code> on the object and then it finds all references remaining.
This is great, because it means that <code>Destroy()</code> will have been called before it starts to find references,
so the only references you'll find will be the ones preventing the object from <code>qdel()</code>ing gracefully.</p>
<p>If you have a datum or something you are not destroying directly (say via the singulo),
the next tool is <code>QDEL_HINT_FINDREFERENCE</code>. You can return this in <code>Destroy()</code> (where you would normally <code>return ..()</code>),
to print a list of references once it enters the GC queue.</p>
<p>You can define 'GC_FAILURE_HARD_LOOKUP' to check for references on all hard_dels. Defining 'FIND_REF_NO_CHECK_TICK' will cause the game to
freeze, so do not define this on live.</p>
<p>If you are only using the reference_tracking system, you do not need to define 'TESTING'; All results are logged in runtime logs</p>
<p>Finally is a verb, &quot;Show qdel() Log&quot;, which shows the deletion log that the garbage subsystem keeps. This is helpful if you are having race conditions or need to review the order of deletions.</p>
<p>By using these methods of finding references, you can make your life far, far easier when dealing with <code>qdel()</code> failures.</p></td></tr>
        <tr><th>/<a href="datum.html">datum</a>/qdel_item</th><td>Qdel Item: Holds statistics on each type that passes thru qdel
Holds the type as a string for this type
Total number of times it's passed thru qdel.
Total amount of milliseconds spent processing this type's Destroy()
Times it was queued for soft deletion but failed to soft delete.
Different from failures because it also includes QDEL_HINT_HARDDEL deletions
Total amount of milliseconds spent hard deleting this type.
Highest time spent hard_deleting this in ms.
Number of times hard deletes took longer than the configured threshold
Number of times it's not respected force=TRUE
Number of times it's not even bother to give a qdel hint
Number of times it's slept in its destroy</td></tr>
