/**
 * # Discord Subsystem
 *
 * This subsystem handles some integrations with discord
 *
 *
 * NOTES:
 * * There is a DB table to track ckeys and associated discord IDs. (discord_link)
 * * This system REQUIRES TGS for notifying users at end of the round
 * * The SS uses fire() instead of just pure shutdown, so people can be notified if it comes back after a crash, where the SS wasn't properly shutdown
 * * It only writes to the disk every 5 minutes, and it won't write to disk if the file is the same as it was the last time it was written. This is to save on disk writes
 * * The system is kept per-server (EG: Terry will not notify people who pressed notify on Sybil), but the accounts are between servers so you dont have to relink on each server.
 *
 *
 * ## HOW NOTIFYING WORKS
 *
 * ### ROUNDSTART:
 * 1) The file is loaded and the discord IDs are extracted
 * 2) A ping is sent to the discord with the IDs of people who wished to be notified
 * 3) The file is emptied
 *
 * ### MIDROUND:
 * 1) Someone usees the notify verb, it adds their discord ID to the list.
 * 2) On fire, it will write that to the disk, as long as conditions above are correct
 *
 * ### END ROUND:
 * 1) The file is force-saved, incase it hasn't fired at end round
 *
 * This is an absolute clusterfuck, but its my clusterfuck -aa07
