/*
	Atmos processes

	These procs generalize various processes used by atmos machinery, such as pumping, filtering, or scrubbing gas, allowing them to be reused elsewhere.
	If no gas was moved/pumped/filtered/whatever, they return a negative number.
	Otherwise they return the amount of energy needed to do whatever it is they do (equivalently power if done over 1 second).
	In the case of free-flowing gas you can do things with gas and still use 0 power, hence the distinction between negative and non-negative return values.
