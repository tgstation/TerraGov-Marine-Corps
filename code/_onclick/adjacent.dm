/*
	Adjacency proc for determining touch range

	This is mostly to determine if a user can enter a square for the purposes of touching something.
	Examples include reaching a square diagonally or reaching something on the other side of a glass window.

	This is calculated by looking for border items, or in the case of clicking diagonally from yourself, dense items.
	This proc will NOT notice if you are trying to attack a window on the other side of a dense object in its turf.  There is a window helper for that.

	Note that in all cases the neighbor is handled simply; this is usually the user's mob, in which case it is up to you
	to check that the mob is not inside of something

	Aside: throwpass does not do what I thought it did originally, and is only used for checking whether or not
	a thrown object should stop after already successfully entering a square.  Currently the throw code involved
	only seems to affect hitting mobs, because the checks performed against objects are already performed when
	entering or leaving the square.  Since throwpass isn't used on mobs, but only on objects, it is effectively
	useless.  Throwpass may later need to be removed and replaced with a passcheck (bitfield on movable atom passflags).

	Since I don't want to complicate the click code rework by messing with unrelated systems it won't be changed here.
