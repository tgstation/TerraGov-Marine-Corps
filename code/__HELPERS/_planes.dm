// This file contains helper macros for plane operations
// See the planes section of Visuals.md for more detail, but essentially
// When we render multiz, we do it by placing all atoms on lower levels on well, lower planes
// This is done with stacks of plane masters (things we use to apply effects to planes)
// These macros exist to facilitate working with this system, and other associated small bits

/// Takes an atom to change the plane of, a new plane value, and something that can be used as a reference to a z level as input
/// Modifies the new value to match the plane we actually want. Note, if you pass in an already offset plane the offsets will add up
/// Use PLANE_TO_TRUE() to avoid this
#define SET_PLANE(thing, new_value, z_reference) (thing.plane = MUTATE_PLANE(new_value, z_reference))

/// Takes a plane and a z reference, and offsets the plane by the mutation
/// The SSmapping.max_plane_offset bit here is technically redundant, but saves a bit of work in the base case

/// Takes an object, new plane, and multipler, and offsets the plane
/// This is for cases where you have a multipler precalculated, and just want to use it
/// Often an optimization, sometimes a necessity

// This is an unrolled and optimized version of SET_PLANE, for use anywhere where you are unsure of a source's "turfness"
// We do also try and guess at what the thing's z level is, even if it's not a z

// Potentially too much client load? Hard to tell due to not having a potato pc to hand.
// This is solvable with lowspec preferences, which would not be hard to implement
// Player popups will now render their effects, like overlay lights. this is fixable, but I've not gotten to it
// I think overlay lights can render on the wrong z layer. s fucked
