	Modular armor pieces

	These are straight armor attachments that equip into 1 of 3 slots on modular armor
	There are chest arms and leg variants, each with their own light medium and heavy armor (not mentioning special types)

	Each armor will merge its armor with the modular armor on attachment and remove it when detached, similar with other stats like slowdown.
