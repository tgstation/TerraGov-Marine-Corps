	name = "Rifleman Tutorial"
	info = {"As a rifleman, you are suited for virtually all theatres of combat.\
	Your AR-12 assault rifle is accurate and effective at all ranges, and its powerful underbarrel grenade launcher poses even further danger to mid-range threats.\
	Inside your backpack is a box of flares to refill your flare pouch, gauze and ointment for brute (slashes) and burn (acid) wounds respectively,\
	and backup magazines for your AR 12.\
	Your belt contains backup magazines for your AR-12, while your body armor contains additional grenades to reload your underbarrel grenade launcher.\
	Your left pocket contains a flare gun holster and several flares.\
	Your right pocket contains a first aid kit, with Bicaridine (heals brute damage), Kelotane (heals burn damage), Tramadol (a painkiller),\
	Tricordrazine (heals all damage, but slowly), and Dylovene (heals toxin damage), as well as splints and inaprovaline.\
	Your helmet contains two protein bars, in case you get hungry, and your boots contain a standard-issue combat knife for clearing weeds or breaking things.<BR>
	<BR>
	Try to spend as much time as possible near other marines - being alone is very dangerous.\
	Your versatility is an immense strength and makes you the ideal battle buddy for virtually any other marine.\
	You can easily work with a shotgunner to clear close quarters areas, or perhaps with a machine gunner to hold a fortified position, or even take point in front of a marksman.\
	When not in immediate danger, use your flare gun to keep your surroundings lit, as your and your fellow marines' lives may very well depend on it.<BR>
	<BR>
	<b>TIPS</b><BR>
	<BR>
	BKTT is an acronym used to describe the combination of Bicaridine, Kelotane, Tricordizine, and Tramadol used as an all-rounder combat medicine mix for any situation\
	that heals all different types of damage. Make sure not to take more than two of each pill at a time - medicine takes a while to process through your system,\
	and too many at once risks a dangerous overdose.\
	Your gauze and ointment are body-part specific, unlike medication, but once you start applying one, you will keep applying it to all body parts that require treatment\
	as long as you hold still. You can remove pills from their packets directly by right-clicking on the packet, even while it's in storage.<BR>
	<BR>
	While holding your AR-12, use Z to wield your weapon with both hands, increasing accuracy and stability and reducing recoil.\
	In the top left of your screen are several weapon-specific buttons. The "Take Aim" button toggles aim mode, a feature that slows your rate of fire\
	in exchange for allowing you to shoot through allied marines. (Note that your grenades will NOT go through marines!)\
	The second option changes the firing mode, between Single Automatic, Burst, and Burst Automatic.\
	Automatic modes will keep firing as long as you hold down the mouse button.\
	The third option enables your underbarrel grenade launcher. Once enabled, you can use right-click to launch a grenade out!<BR>
	<BR>
	On running out of ammo, the empty magazine will automatically eject from the rifle.\
	To reload, simply grab a new magazine with an empty hand and click your gun with it.\
	Alternatively, you can perform a tactical reload by click-dragging the magazine from its storage directly onto the rifle,\
	which can be done without an empty hand and with a different magazine still in the gun.\
	You can reload the underbarrel launcher by right-clicking on the gun while holding a valid grenade (like the HEDP grenades in your webbing).<BR>
	<BR>
	Your flare gun can be rapidly reloaded by just right-clicking the flare pouch with it in hand.\
	Your flare pouch can be refilled by left-clicking on it while holding a flare box.
	Flare any dark area you can see to reduce the risk of a xenomorph ambushing you.\
	On a similar note, your suit's light can be toggled in the top left - you should almost always keep this on to help your visibility.<BR>
	<BR>
	Your P23 has a pistol lace attached.\
	By toggling it in the top left while wielding it, it becomes impossible for you to drop - or for it to be knocked out of your hand by a xenomorph.\
	Similarly, your AR-12 has a magnetic harness, which means if you drop it or otherwise lose it, it'll automatically snap back to your armor.<BR>
	<BR>
	Because your AR-12 can effectively engage at all ranges, your optimal range is whatever your opponent's optimal range isn't.\
	Try keeping the distance from ferocious melee enemies, while getting too close for comfort with squishier ranged ones."}

	name = "Machinegunner Tutorial"
	info = {"As a machinegunner, you are the backbone of a marine force. While you possess heavy armor reinforced with\
	Tyr-pattern plating (strengthening its defense even further against melee attacks), your slow move speed and the unwieldy nature of your MG-60 machinegun\
	means you should not be spearheading any pushes. Aim mode is your best friend - combined with your bipod, you are very apt at sitting just behind the front line,\
	eliminating threats and keeping the marines in front of you safe.\
	Your backpack contains several additional box magazines, allowing you to carry almost two THOUSAND rounds on your person at any time.\
	Your left pouch contains a first aid kit, complete with Bicaridine (heals brute damage), Kelotane (heals burn damage), Tramadol (a painkiller),\
	Tricordrazine (heals all damage, but slowly), and Dylovene (heals toxin damage), as well as splints and inaprovaline.\
	Your right pocket contains a flare gun holster and several flares. Your suit storage contains two plasma pistols, which are low in damage but can start fires.\
	Your webbing contains an MRE to eat and both gauze and ointment, your helmet contains two protein bars for further eating,\
	and your boots contain a standard-issue combat knife for clearing weeds or breaking things.<BR>
	<BR>
	Your full strength is hard to utilize on your own or in the very front of battle.\
	Your ideal positions are either safely behind a barricade guarding a front or flank from assault,\
	or behind your fellow marines, shooting over them with aim mode to protect them from enemies.\
	Keep in mind that your heavy armor and weapon means you move rather slowly - so if you get the order to leave a position, get moving early to avoid being left behind.<BR>

	If you drop your machine gun, or have a xenomorph make you drop it, your machine gun will automatically return to your armor if it's attached.<BR>
	<BR>
	If you are facehugged, quickly take out your plasma pistol and shoot the ground with it, then walk into the fire.\
	While this will cause you to be set on fire, facehuggers will detach in the presence of fire, preventing you from becoming infected.\
	You can press B (or click resist in the bottom right) once the facehugger has detached to stop, drop, and roll, extinguishing the fire.<BR>
	<BR>
	Your impressive magazine size means you don't need to reload often.\
	You can suppress one spot for an impressive amount of time, and you have the ammo and damage to clear out resin walls.<BR>

	The more bullets you shoot, the better a marine you are. It's actually that simple."}

	name = "Marksman Tutorial"
	info = {"As a marksman, you are a master of precision and range, and should utilize both of these advantages as much as possible.\
	Your DMR-37 is incredibly accurate at long ranges and packs a devastating punch. Due to your ability to engage at long range - and conversely,\
	your inability to engage properly at short range - you should be staying as far from conflict as possible while still remaining in your rifle's effective range.\
	Your backpack and both of your pouches contain spare magazines for your DMR. Your backpack also contains an MRE to eat, and both gauze and ointment for treating injuries.\
	Your armor contains Bicaridine (heals brute damage), Kelotane (heals burn damage), Tramadol (a painkiller),\
	Tricordrazine (heals all damage, but slowly), and an inaprovaline injector for helping other marines in critical condition.\

	Try holding your fire until your target is already engaging someone else. While this may seem counter-intuitive,\
	it allows you to wait until they've already committed to a fight (that's likely to damage them) and may cause them to not notice your presence until it's too late,\
	increasing the odds of securing a kill.<BR>
	<BR>
	Do not attempt to use your DMR at too close of a range, as marksman weapons have a chance to miss against enemies that are near you.\

	The requisitions-exclusive incendiary slugs aren't quite as powerful as standard slugs but set anything they hit on fire!<BR>
	<BR>
	The green M50 signal flares in your body armor don't last as long as normal flares but deploying them signals to CAS (close air support)\
	that you're requesting an airstrike in the region, also granting them the ability to see and shoot at xenomorphs in the area.<BR>
	<BR>
	Using the powerful knockback of your shotgun to knock xenomorphs TOWARDS other marines is a good way to get kills\
	- most xenomorphs can't deal with that many marines at once!<BR>

	just be careful about any xenomorphs lurking in the mazes!<BR>
	<BR>
	Requisitions offers many useful upgrades to your kit. You can request a SURT pyrotechnic module for your armor that will make you unable to be set on fire.\
	You can also request X Fuel, a fuel for flamethrowers that burns hotter for longer and appears blue.\
	<BR>
	Your laser carbine is good for short-range defense. You can toggle the modes of it using unique action (default: space bar).\

	You are the most mobile among smartgunners - use this to your advantage. You are the best at providing cover fire for a mobile squad."}

	name = "Smartminigunner Tutorial"
	info = {"As the smartminigunner, you are the very embodiment of BRRT. With your huge SG-85 smart minigun,\
	you can fire ten rounds per second for one hundred straight seconds, providing powerful covering fire for other marines.\
	No enemy wants to get stuck in your line of fire. Instead of a backpack you carry a back mounted powerpack that feeds and powers your SG-85.\
	In your body armor are two bins to refill your powerpack with.  Your left pouch contains a flare gun holster and several flares. \
	Your right pouch contains a first aid kit, complete with Bicaridine (heals brute damage), Kelotane (heals burn damage),\
	Tramadol (a painkiller), Tricordrazine (heals all damage, but slowly), and Dylovene (heals toxin damage),\
	as well as splints and inaprovaline. Your webbing contains flares for creating lights and gauze and ointment for treating injuries.\
	Your helmet and boots contain food, in case you get hungry.<BR>
	<BR>
	Your minigun boasts both high levels of armor piercing and the ability to shoot through allies - use both to your advantage.\
	Note that the heavy nature of your minigun and your brief windup before you can fire means you're best positioned defensively, firing at the toughest targets within range.<BR>
	<BR>
	<b>TIPS</b><BR>
	BKTT is an acronym that is used to describe the combination of Bicaridine, Kelotane, Tricordizine, and Tramadol used as an all-rounder combat medicine mix\
	for any situation that heals all different types of damage. Make sure not to take more than two of each pill at a time - medicine takes a while to process\
	through your system, and too many at once risks a dangerous overdose. Your gauze and ointment are body-part specific, unlike medication, but once you start\
	applying one, you will keep applying it to all body parts that require treatment as long as you hold still. Your splints are used to alleviate the effects of bone fractures,\
	by applying them to a fractured limb. Your inaprovaline autoinjector is not to be applied to yourself - rather, it should be applied to an alive marine that is\
	so heavily injured they are unconscious on the ground (referred to as "critical condition") to rescue them from that state.\
	You can remove pills from their packets directly by right clicking on the packet, even while it's in storage.<BR>
	<BR>
	Your flare gun can be rapidly reloaded by just right clicking the flare pouch with it in hand.\
	Your flare pouch can be refilled by left clicking on it while holding a flare box.\
	Flare any dark area you can see to reduce the risk of a xenomorph ambushing you.\
	On a similar note, your suit's light can be toggled in the top left - you should almost always keep this on to help your visibility.<BR>
	<BR>
	On your belt is a belt harness. By left clicking on your belt harness with your minigun, you can attach them.\
	If you drop your minigun, or have a xenomorph make you drop it, your machine gun will automatically return to your armor if it's attached.\
	On the same note, by left clicking your powerpack, you hook up your minigun, allowing it to draw from it for ammo.\
	If you drop your minigun, even if it's saved by the belt harness, you will have to re-attach it to the powerpack.<BR>
	<BR>
	To reload your power back, take it into your hand, then grab an ammo bin with your other hand and click the power pack with it.<BR>
	<BR>
	While holding your SG-85, use Z to wield your weapon with both hands, which is required to fire it. In the top left of your screen are several weapon-specific buttons.\
	The tactical sensor option toggles your tactical sensor - you should keep this on always.<BR>
	<BR>
	Your tactical sensor will periodically blip, detecting moving targets in an area a little bigger than your screen.\
	Green circles are friendly targets (or anyone wearing a marine ID), while red circles accompanied with an audible blip are unknown (almost always hostile) targets.\
	This sensor works even without vision, such as through any form of smoke and through walls.<BR>

	Your ammunition refills will come from Requisitions. To request something, say :u followed by a clear and polite request as to what you would like to receive.\
	For example, if you ran out of ammo, you might say ":u RO, requesting SG-85 bins to the FC's beacon."\

	After some time, you should hear a WOOSH noise, and a box will teleport to the beacon with what you requested.\
	Note that requisitions is the ONLY place you can get more smartgun ammo!<BR>
	<BR>
	STAY BEHIND OTHER MARINES. I cannot stress this enough. You are a priority target for xenomorphs due to your ability to provide covering fire from behind other marines.<BR>
	<BR>
	You almost never need to reload - you have enough rounds to fire for almost two straight minutes.\
	Because of this, you should exclusively reload when it is completely safe to do so, as other marines are counting on you to protect them.<BR>
	<BR>
	Your minigun boasts an incredibly high amount of armor piercing. Aim for particularly durable targets, like Crushers and Kings, as you'll likely do a lot more damage."}
