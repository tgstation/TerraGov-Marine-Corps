	name = "Rifleman Tutorial"
	info = {"As a rifleman, you are suited for virtually all theatres of combat. \
	Your AR-12 assault rifle is accurate and effective at all ranges, and its powerful underbarrel grenade launcher poses even further danger to mid-range threats. \
	Inside your backpack is a box of flares to refill your flare pouch, gauze and ointment for brute (slashes) and burn (acid) wounds respectively, \
	and backup magazines for your AR 12. \
	Your belt contains backup magazines for your AR-12, while your body armor contains additional grenades to reload your underbarrel grenade launcher. \
	Your left pocket contains a flare gun holster and several flares. \
	Your right pocket contains a first aid kit, with Bicaridine (heals brute damage), Kelotane (heals burn damage), Tramadol (a painkiller), \
	Tricordrazine (heals all damage, but slowly), and Dylovene (heals toxin damage), as well as splints and inaprovaline. \
	Your helmet contains two protein bars, in case you get hungry, and your boots contain a standard-issue combat knife for clearing weeds or breaking things.<BR>
	<BR>
	Try to spend as much time as possible near other marines - being alone is very dangerous. \
	Your versatility is an immense strength and makes you the ideal battle buddy for virtually any other marine. \
	You can easily work with a shotgunner to clear close quarters areas, or perhaps with a machine gunner to hold a fortified position, or even take point in front of a marksman. \
	When not in immediate danger, use your flare gun to keep your surroundings lit, as your and your fellow marines' lives may very well depend on it.<BR>
	<BR>
	<b>TIPS</b><BR>
	<BR>
	BKTT is an acronym used to describe the combination of Bicaridine, Kelotane, Tricordizine, and Tramadol used as an all-rounder combat medicine mix for any situation \
	that heals all different types of damage. Make sure not to take more than two of each pill at a time - medicine takes a while to process through your system, \
	and too many at once risks a dangerous overdose. \
	Your gauze and ointment are body-part specific, unlike medication, but once you start applying one, you will keep applying it to all body parts that require treatment \
	as long as you hold still. You can remove pills from their bottles directly by right-clicking on the bottle, even while it's in storage.<BR>
	<BR>
	While holding your AR-12, use Z to wield your weapon with both hands, increasing accuracy and stability and reducing recoil. \
	In the top left of your screen are several weapon-specific buttons. The "Take Aim" button toggles aim mode, a feature that slows your rate of fire \
	in exchange for allowing you to shoot through allied marines. (Note that your grenades will NOT go through marines!) \
	The second option changes the firing mode, between Single Automatic, Burst, and Burst Automatic. \
	Automatic modes will keep firing as long as you hold down the mouse button. \
	The third option enables your underbarrel grenade launcher. Once enabled, you can use right-click to launch a grenade out!<BR>
	<BR>
	On running out of ammo, the empty magazine will automatically eject from the rifle. \
	To reload, simply grab a new magazine with an empty hand and click your gun with it. \
	Alternatively, you can perform a tactical reload by click-dragging the magazine from its storage directly onto the rifle, \
	which can be done without an empty hand and with a different magazine still in the gun. \
	You can reload the underbarrel launcher by right-clicking on the gun while holding a valid grenade (like the HEDP grenades in your webbing).<BR>
	<BR>
	Your flare gun can be rapidly reloaded by just right-clicking the flare pouch with it in hand. \
	Your flare pouch can be refilled by left-clicking on it while holding a flare box. \
	Flare any dark area you can see to reduce the risk of a xenomorph ambushing you. \
	On a similar note, your suit's light can be toggled in the top left - you should almost always keep this on to help your visibility.<BR>
	<BR>
	Your P23 has a pistol lace attached. \
	By toggling it in the top left while wielding it, it becomes impossible for you to drop - or for it to be knocked out of your hand by a xenomorph. \
	Similarly, your AR-12 has a magnetic harness, which means if you drop it or otherwise lose it, it'll automatically snap back to your armor.<BR>
	<BR>
	Because your AR-12 can effectively engage at all ranges, your optimal range is whatever your opponent's optimal range isn't. \
	Try keeping the distance from ferocious melee enemies, while getting too close for comfort with squishier ranged ones."}

	name = "Machinegunner Tutorial"
	info = {"As a machinegunner, you are the backbone of a marine force. While you possess heavy armor reinforced with \
	Tyr-pattern plating (strengthening its defense even further against melee attacks), your slow move speed and the unwieldy nature of your MG-60 machinegun \
	means you should not be spearheading any pushes. Aim mode is your best friend - combined with your bipod, you are very apt at sitting just behind the front line, \
	eliminating threats and keeping the marines in front of you safe. \
	Your backpack contains several additional box magazines, allowing you to carry almost two THOUSAND rounds on your person at any time. \
	Your left pouch contains a first aid kit, complete with Bicaridine (heals brute damage), Kelotane (heals burn damage), Tramadol (a painkiller), \
	Tricordrazine (heals all damage, but slowly), and Dylovene (heals toxin damage), as well as splints and inaprovaline. \
	Your right pocket contains a flare gun holster and several flares. Your suit storage contains two plasma pistols, which are low in damage but can start fires. \
	Your webbing contains an MRE to eat and both gauze and ointment, your helmet contains two protein bars for further eating, \
	and your boots contain a standard-issue combat knife for clearing weeds or breaking things.<BR>
	<BR>
	Your full strength is hard to utilize on your own or in the very front of battle. \
	Your ideal positions are either safely behind a barricade guarding a front or flank from assault, \
	or behind your fellow marines, shooting over them with aim mode to protect them from enemies. \
	Keep in mind that your heavy armor and weapon means you move rather slowly - so if you get the order to leave a position, get moving early to avoid being left behind.<BR>

	While this will cause you to be set on fire, facehuggers will detach in the presence of fire, preventing you from becoming infected. \
	You can press B (or click resist in the bottom right) once the facehugger has detached to stop, drop, and roll, extinguishing the fire.<BR>
	<BR>
	Your impressive magazine size means you don't need to reload often. \
	You can suppress one spot for an impressive amount of time, and you have the ammo and damage to clear out resin walls.<BR>

	name = "Marksman Tutorial"
	info = {"As a marksman, you are a master of precision and range, and should utilize both of these advantages as much as possible. \
	Your DMR-37 is incredibly accurate at long ranges and packs a devastating punch. Due to your ability to engage at long range - and conversely, \
	your inability to engage properly at short range - you should be staying as far from conflict as possible while still remaining in your rifle's effective range. \
	Your backpack and both of your pouches contain spare magazines for your DMR. Your backpack also contains an MRE to eat, and both gauze and ointment for treating injuries. \
	Your armor contains Bicaridine (heals brute damage), Kelotane (heals burn damage), Tramadol (a painkiller), \

	increasing the odds of securing a kill.<BR>
	<BR>
	Do not attempt to use your DMR at too close of a range, as marksman weapons have a chance to miss against enemies that are near you. \

	The requisitions-exclusive incendiary slugs aren't quite as powerful as standard slugs but set anything they hit on fire!<BR>
	<BR>
	The green M50 signal flares in your body armor don't last as long as normal flares but deploying them signals to CAS (close air support) \
	that you're requesting an airstrike in the region, also granting them the ability to see and shoot at xenomorphs in the area.<BR>
	<BR>
	Using the powerful knockback of your shotgun to knock xenomorphs TOWARDS other marines is a good way to get kills \

	<BR>
	Red resin walls are fire-resistant and require you to engage them in close quarters with a melee weapon to detroy them - the bayonet on your laser carbine is good for this,\
	just be careful about any xenomorphs lurking in the mazes!<BR>
	<BR>
	Requisitions offers many useful upgrades to your kit. You can request a SURT pyrotechnic module for your armor that will make you unable to be set on fire. \
	You can also request X Fuel, a fuel for flamethrowers that burns hotter for longer and appears blue. \
	<BR>
	Your laser carbine is good for short-range defense. You can toggle the modes of it using unique action (default: space bar). \
	The spread mode deals greater armor penetration and damage but is slow to fire. Impact mode knocks back targets. Cripple mode will slow enemies down.<BR>

	<BR>
	The AR11 has a much higher firerate while on burst mode. Click the ability icon or set a Switch Fire Mode keybind to swap it to burst auto.<BR>
	<BR>
	You can deploy your mortar by ctrl-clicking it onto an adjacent tile. \
	You can manually input coordinates to fire with it, but instead you should use the rangefinders in your webbing to do this. \
	Clicking the mortar with your rangefinder will link it, and you can then zoom and ctrl-click on any tile to send those coordinates to the mortar. \
	To fire a shell, simply put one into the mortar then right click if you have marked coordinates. \
	If it gets damaged, you can quickly pick it back up by dragging it to your character. You can also repair it using your welder.<BR>
	<BR>
	Mortars have a minimum range of 15 tiles that you must fire outside. \
	Shells will have an extra tile of variance every 15 tiles they fly. You can manually correct for this by modifying the Latitude and Longitude Offsets. \
	When you run out, extra shells can be purchased from requisitions. Use the :u prefix to access the requisitions radio channel.<BR>
	<BR>
	Explosive shells should be used for direct attacks. Hitting resting xenos while they heal can buy significant time for your allies to push. \
	Incendiary shells can be used for both direct attacks and as a deterrant. \
	Launching an incendiary shell onto a xenomorph's only escape route can often result in a kill. \
	Tanglefoot shells drain the plasma of any xenomorph that stay inside the gas, preventing them from using abilities. \
	This means it is perfectly safe to fire tanglefoot onto your allies, \
	and can be especially useful when pushing a dangerous choke or attempting to rescue dead marines.<BR>
	<BR>
	In your suit you will find a spare powercell. When fixing apcs swap the empty battery for your full one.<BR>

	name = "Hypobelt Tutorial"
	info = {"As the hypobelt medic, you are the master of rapid healing. \
	Your belt is full of hyposprays which instantly apply a dose of medicine when you click a marine with them. \
	Examine them with shift+click to read their labels to find out what they do. \
	Avoid injecting someone more than once or twice with the same medicine to prevent an overdose! \
	Your pouch contains three stacks of trauma and burn kits, which will cause a body part they're applied to to heal brute or burn damage over time respectively. \
	It also contains a hypospray full of MeraDerm, a medicine mixture that heals both brute and burn damage quickly. \
	These hyposprays can be refilled by the bottles in the syringe cases of your belt. \
	Your webbing is filled with splints for treating fractures. \
	Your body armor contains Oxycodone, a painkiller; a stasis bag to hold patients you aren't actively treating in to prevent their condition from worsening; \
	tweezers to remove shrapnel; a roller bed to roll around patients with; and a medivac to evacuate patients. \
	Your boots and helmet contain food.<BR>
	<BR>
	Your light armor and quick injectors make you adept at rapidly getting marines back into the action. \
	However, take care to avoid danger; xenomorphs WILL target you, and you will go down fast without proper protection.<BR>
	<BR>
	<b>TIPS</b><BR>
	<BR>
	Your gloves are medical analyzers (unless you're a robot, in which case you can't wear gloves), which you can use on a patient by left clicking them. \

	Right-click with the analyzer instead shows them their own health scan, useful for getting their attention or informing them that they're fully healed.<BR>
	<BR>
	In your backpack is a defibrillator. By holding it and clicking on any dead target with their exosuit removed (drag their sprite onto your sprite to remove it) \
	you will attempt to bring them back to life, healing them somewhat and then resuscitating them if they're healed enough. \
	Drag your defib to your backpack to recharge them. This even works on robots!<BR>

	name = "Smartmachinegunner Tutorial"
	info = {"As the smartmachinegunner, you are the very backbone of your squad, and should be behind another marine or three at all times. \
	Your SG-29 is capable of firing directly through your teammates without risk of harm, so staying safe and behind your allies is essential \
	to gaining full value out of it. Your backpack and body armor contain both fire extinguisher and spare ammo, with your backpack also containing \
	a plasma pistol to start fires with, inaprovaline, and a cloak grenade to escape skirmishes. Your left pouch contains a flare gun holster and several flares. \
	Your right pouch contains a first aid kit complete with Bicaridine (heals brute damage), Kelotane (heals burn damage), Tramadol (a painkiller), \
	Tricordrazine (heals all damage, but slowly), and Dylovene (heals toxin damage), as well as splints and inaprovaline. \
	Your webbing contains flares for creating lights and gauze and ointment for treating injuries. \
	Your helmet and boots contain food, in case you get hungry.<BR>
	<BR>
	You should NEVER be at the front of a group of marines. \
	Aim to provide covering fire for those who are in front, and let them protect you in turn by, well, being in front of you. \
	Remember that your SG-29 fires through marines, so you don't need to worry about friendly fire.<BR>
	<BR>
	<b>TIPS</b><BR>
	<BR>
	BKTT is an acronym that is used to describe the combination of Bicaridine, Kelotane, Tricordizine, and Tramadol used as an all-rounder combat medicine mix \
	for any situation that heals all different types of damage. Make sure not to take more than two of each pill at a time - medicine takes a while to process \
	through your system, and too many at once risks a dangerous overdose. \
	Your gauze and ointment are body-part specific, unlike medication, but once you start applying one, you will keep applying it to all body parts that \
	require treatment as long as you hold still. Your splints are used to alleviate the effects of bone fractures, by applying them to a fractured limb. \
	Your inaprovaline autoinjector is not to be applied to yourself - rather, it should be applied to an alive marine that is so heavily injured they are unconscious \
	on the ground (referred to as "critical condition") to rescue them from that state. \
	You can remove pills from their bottles directly by right-clicking on the bottle, even while it's in storage.<BR>
	<BR>
	Your flare gun can be rapidly reloaded by just right-clicking the flare pouch with it in hand. \
	Your flare pouch can be refilled by left clicking on it while holding a flare box. \
	Flare any dark area you can see to reduce the risk of a xenomorph ambushing you. \
	On a similar note, your suit's light can be toggled in the top left - you should almost always keep this on to help your visibility.<BR>
	<BR>
	On your belt is a belt harness. By left clicking on your belt harness with your machine gun, you can attach them. \
	If you drop your machine gun, or have a xenomorph make you drop it, your machine gun will automatically return to your armor if it's attached.<BR>
	<BR>
	If you are facehugged, quickly take out your plasma pistol and shoot the ground with it, then walk into the fire. \
	While this will cause you to be set on fire, facehuggers will detach in the presence of fire, preventing you from becoming infected. \
	You can press B (or click resist in the bottom right) once the facehugger has detached to stop, drop, and roll, extinguishing the fire.<BR>
	<BR>
	Your impressive magazine size means you don't need to reload often. You can suppress one spot for an impressive amount of time, \
	and you have the ammo and damage to clear out resin walls.<BR>
	<BR>
	While holding your SG-29, use Z to wield your weapon with both hands, increasing accuracy and stability and reducing recoil. \
	In the top left of your screen are several weapon-specific buttons. The tactical sensor option toggles your tactical sensor - you should keep this on always.<BR>
	<BR>
	Your tactical sensor will periodically blip, detecting moving targets in an area a little bigger than your screen. \
	Green circles are friendly targets (or anyone wearing a marine ID), while red circles accompanied with an audible blip are unknown (almost always hostile) targets. \
	This sensor works even without vision, such as through any form of smoke and through walls.<BR>
	<BR>
	On running out of ammo, the empty magazine will automatically eject from the smartgun. To reload, simply grab a new magazine with an empty hand \
	and click your gun with it. Alternatively, you can perform a tactical reload by click-dragging the magazine from its storage directly onto the rifle, \
	which can be done without an empty hand and with a different magazine still in the gun.<BR>
	<BR>
	STAY BEHIND OTHER MARINES. I cannot stress this enough. You are a priority target for xenomorphs due to your ability to provide covering fire from behind other marines.<BR>
	<BR>
	Your massive drum size of 250 rounds means you don't need to reload often. Because of this, you should avoid reloading in dangerous areas if you can help it, \
	instead waiting until you're back behind fortifications or other marines.<BR>
	<BR>
	Your ammunition refills will come from Requisitions. To request something, say :u followed by a clear and polite request as to what you would like to receive. \
	For example, if you ran out of ammo, you might say ":u RO, requesting SG-85 bins to the FC's beacon." \
	After some amount of time, you will likely get a response in the requisitions channel (pay attention!) along the lines of "Yourname, your order is ready. Sending." \
	After some time, you should hear a WOOSH noise, and a box will teleport to the beacon with what you requested. \
	Note that requisitions is the ONLY place you can get more smartgun ammo!<BR>
	<BR>
	You are the most mobile among smartgunners - use this to your advantage. You are the best at providing cover fire for a mobile squad."}

	No enemy wants to get stuck in your line of fire. Instead of a backpack you carry a back mounted powerpack that feeds and powers your SG-85. \
	In your body armor are two bins to refill your powerpack with.  Your left pouch contains a flare gun holster and several flares. \

	<BR>
	Your minigun boasts both high levels of armor piercing and the ability to shoot through allies - use both to your advantage. \
