	Step one is to aquire conveyors and a conveyor switch to turn them on in the autolathe. You can link these together by clicking on the conveyor stack with the switch,

	With your starter kit, all machines can be anchored and unanchored by using a wrench on them, and rotated with a screwdriver, where the direction can be seen with the small arrow on the bottom left of the front of the machine.
	Outputters must be refilled with refill kits and clicked with an empty hand to be turned on but all other machines just need to be anchored to work.
	Machines will always output in the direction they are facing and input from the opposite direction.<br>
