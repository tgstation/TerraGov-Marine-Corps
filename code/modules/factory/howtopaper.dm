	With your starter kit, all machines can be anchored and unanchored by using a wrench on them, and rotated with a screwdriver, where the direction can be seen with the small arrow on the bottom left of the front of the machine.

	Machines will always output in the direction they are facing and input from the opposite direction.<br>
