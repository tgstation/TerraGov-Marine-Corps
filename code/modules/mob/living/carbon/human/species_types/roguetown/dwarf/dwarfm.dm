	A proud and robust race of short mountain folk, \
	the dwarves are known for their pride in martial strength \
	and their tenacity towards their ancient traditions.\
	A Dwarf, much like the rock that they carve their fortress out of \
	is stubborn and ancient, with their race being the longest lived of all \
	of the weeping gods creation. They, like stone: also rarely change \
	and tend to shun the modernization of the world around them. \
	Instead, a Dwarf looks to his ancestorial heritage for guidance on \
	the various challenges they face. Even if, in some irony: this behaviour \
	leads the race towards technological advacement as they continue \
	to improve their craft through powerful mechanization and forging \
	Dwarves are hearty, but are not known for their speed or eyesight... \
	Each dwarf hails from a ancient fortress named after the most plentiful mineral."
