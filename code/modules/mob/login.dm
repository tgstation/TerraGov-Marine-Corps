	// BYOND's internal implementation of login does two things
	// 1: Set statobj to the mob being logged into (We got this covered)
	// 2: And I quote "If the mob has no location, place it near (1,1,1) if possible"
	// See, near is doing an agressive amount of legwork there
	// What it actually does is takes the area that (1,1,1) is in, and loops through all those turfs
	// If you successfully move into one, it stops
	// Because we want Move() to mean standard movements rather then just what byond treats it as (ALL moves)
	// We don't allow moves from nullspace -> somewhere. This means the loop has to iterate all the turfs in (1,1,1)'s area
	// For us, (1,1,1) is a space tile. This means roughly 200,000! calls to Move()
	// You do not want this
