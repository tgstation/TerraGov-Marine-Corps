/**
 * A proc that gets the "best" adjacent node in src based on score
 * The score is calculated by what weights are inside of the list/weight_modifiers
 * The highest number after multiplying each list/weight by the ones in the above parameter will be the node that's chosen; any nodes that have the same score won't override that node
 * Generally the number that the weight has before being multiplied by weight modifiers is the "user friendly" edition; NODE_LAST_VISITED represents in deciseconds the time before
 * the node has been visited by a particular thing, while something like NODE_ENEMY_COUNT represents the amount of enemies
 * Parameter call example
 * GetBestAdjNode(list(NODE_LAST_VISITED = -1), IDENTIFIER_XENO)
 * Returns an adjacent node that was last visited; when a AI chose to visit a node, it will set NODE_LAST_VISITED to world.time
