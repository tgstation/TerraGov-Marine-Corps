/*
A multitile vehicle is made up of 2 types of objects, root and hitbox
relaymove() only does something for root
You can inherit and do special stuff for either, but only one will let you move
Rotations treat root as x = 0, y = 0
All of the backend for movement will be under root

Vehicles are placed on the map by a spawner or admin verb
