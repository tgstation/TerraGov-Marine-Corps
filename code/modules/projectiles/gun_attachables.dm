//Gun attachable items code. Lets you add various effects to firearms.
//Some attachables are hardcoded in the projectile firing system, like grenade launchers, flamethrowers.
/*
When you are adding new guns into the attachment list, or even old guns, make sure that said guns
properly accept overlays. You can find the proper offsets in the individual gun dms, so make sure
you set them right. It's a pain to go back to find which guns are set incorrectly.
To summarize: rail attachments should go on top of the rail. For rifles, this usually means the middle of the gun.
For handguns, this is usually toward the back of the gun. SMGs usually follow rifles.
Muzzle attachments should connect to the barrel, not sit under or above it. The only exception is the bayonet.
Underrail attachments should just fit snugly, that's about it. Stocks are pretty obvious.

All attachment offsets are now in a list, including stocks. Guns that don't take attachments can keep the list null.
