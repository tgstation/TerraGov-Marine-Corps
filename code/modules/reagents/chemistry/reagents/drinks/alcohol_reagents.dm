	 * Boozepwr Chart
	 * Note that all higher effects of alcohol poisoning will inherit effects for smaller amounts (i.e. light poisoning inherts from slight poisoning)
	 * In addition, severe effects won't always trigger unless the drink is poisonously strong
	 * All effects don't start immediately, but rather get worse over time; the rate is affected by the imbiber's alcohol tolerance
	 * 0: Non-alcoholic
	 * 1-10: Barely classifiable as alcohol - occassional slurring
	 * 11-20: Slight alcohol content - slurring
	 * 21-30: Below average - imbiber begins to look slightly drunk
	 * 31-40: Just below average - no unique effects
	 * 41-50: Average - mild disorientation, imbiber begins to look drunk
	 * 51-60: Just above average - disorientation, vomiting, imbiber begins to look heavily drunk
	 * 61-70: Above average - small chance of blurry vision, imbiber begins to look smashed
	 * 71-80: High alcohol content - blurry vision, imbiber completely shitfaced
	 * 81-90: Extremely high alcohol content - toxin damage, passing out
	 * 91-100: Dangerously toxic - brain damage, probable liver failure.
	 * 101 and beyond: Lethally toxic - Swift death.
