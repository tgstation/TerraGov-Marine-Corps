/*
Boozepwr Chart
Note that all higher effects of alcohol poisoning will inherit effects for smaller amounts (i.e. light poisoning inherts from slight poisoning)
In addition, severe effects won't always trigger unless the drink is poisonously strong
All effects don't start immediately, but rather get worse over time; the rate is affected by the imbiber's alcohol tolerance
0: Non-alcoholic
1-10: Barely classifiable as alcohol - occassional slurring
11-20: Slight alcohol content - slurring
21-30: Below average - imbiber begins to look slightly drunk
31-40: Just below average - no unique effects
41-50: Average - mild disorientation, imbiber begins to look drunk
51-60: Just above average - disorientation, vomiting, imbiber begins to look heavily drunk
61-70: Above average - small chance of blurry vision, imbiber begins to look smashed
71-80: High alcohol content - blurry vision, imbiber completely shitfaced
81-90: Extremely high alcohol content - toxin damage, passing out
91-100: Dangerously toxic - brain damage, probable liver failure.
101 and beyond: Lethally toxic - Swift death.
