// Every cycle, the pump uses the air in air_in to try and make air_out the perfect pressure.
//
// node1, air1, network1 correspond to input
// node2, air2, network2 correspond to output
//
// Thus, the two variables affect pump operation are set in New():
//   air1.volume
//     This is the volume of gas available to the pump that may be transfered to the output
//   air2.volume
//     Higher quantities of this cause more air to be perfected later
//     but overall network volume is also increased as this increases...
