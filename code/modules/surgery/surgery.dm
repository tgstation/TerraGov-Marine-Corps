//specific steps for some surgeries (fluff text)
//more interesting failure options
//randomised complications
//more surgeries!
//add a probability modifier for the state of the surgeon- health, twitching, etc. blindness, god forbid.

//RESOLVED ISSUES //"Todo" jobs that have been completed
//combine hands/feet into the arms - Hands/feet were removed - RR
//surgeries (not steps) that can be initiated on any body part (corresponding with damage locations) - Call this one done, see possible_locs var - c0
