changes: 
  - tweak: "Staggerstun now affects all carbon life forms."
  - tweak: "Neurospit now applies halloss damage on hit and briefly slows and staggers on hit via staggerstun instead of guaranteed knockdowns. Halloss damage scales with neurospit power and is vs Bio resistance."
  - rscadd: "Stagger greatly reduces accuracy and increases scatter for humanoids."
  - tweak: "Queen loses the gib ability, as this was a no brainer, unfun way to remove people permanently from a round."
  - tweak: "Armors tweaked to account for energy/bio damage types closer to intention."
  - tweak: "Glove acid resistance updated and slightly improved."
  - tweak: "Larval growth sting added to drones."
  - tweak: "Hunter sneak attacks can no longer trigger off pounce, but are more damaging and stagger + slow"
