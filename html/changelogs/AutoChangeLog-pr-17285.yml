changes:
  - refactor: "Refactored the backend for rendering heavily in support of Multi-Z"
  - code_imp: "Added plane controllers properly"
  - refactor: "refactored night vision to support rgb night vision, instead of a flat number"
  - refactor: "Resorted all our layers and compressed them down"
  - bugfix: "This has fixed some previous layering issues (and probably caused new ones)"
  - code_imp: "As a byproduct, some visual related stuff was optimized"
  - rscadd: "NEW PERFORMANCE OPTIONS: Ambient occlusion can be turned off, multi-z parallax can be turned off, multi-z prettiness can be turned down"
  - refactor: "Also changed the rendering method to match the 3/4 perspective. This changes how some layering is performed and may result in some wonkiness in layering. Please make an issue report if you see anything out of place."
  - code_imp: "Added get_turfs_by_zlevel and get_turfs_from_all_zlevels to interface with area turf management. Use this where you can instead of looping over area contents."
  - code_imp: "CODERS!!!: Since we now use SIDE_MAP, pixel_z and pixel_w now actually do something. Go read the guide in github/guides/VISUALS.md"
  - bugfix: "Fixed shuttle walls and the gunner seats' turf on opendream layering under the floor"
  - bugfix: "Fixed some cases where you couldn't see a lit area"
  - bugfix: "Fixed some overlays (e.g lighting) following screen alerts and mugshot announcements"
  - bugfix: "The Splashscreen should immediately load the correct way now"
  - bugfix: "Xeno abilities that distort your screen (e.g ravager or behemoth rage) will now apply it to all game-world objects by default"
  - bugfix: "Improved the layering logic of minimap blips somewhat. They now use a priority layering system"
  - bugfix: "Fixed orbital cannon console layering under the cannon a little"
  - bugfix: "Fixed Orbital cannon, it's tray, and the ship railgun popping in sometimes"
  - bugfix: "Standardized how welders are used, as there was a bunch of unnecessary duplication. Due to this many previously non-welding fuel consuming welds now consume fuel, check if it's on correctly, etc."
  - bugfix: "Fixed using tools on mobs always returning the opposite value"
  - bugfix: "Fixed base lighting not fully respecting it's alpha values"
  - admin: "added a debug/edit planes ui"
  - bugfix: "Fixed issues with some maps having mappers having edited thing's layers and planes"
  - code_imp: "added linting for plane and layer varedits"
  - code_imp: "added MAP_SWITCH for mappers, this allows you to set one variable (like layer or plane) when viewing in the mapviewer, and another in the game"
