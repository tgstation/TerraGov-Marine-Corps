		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='experiment'>Neurotoxin reworked. Spits have almost perfect accuracy and are faster, also being able to be fired once per second more or less across the castes. Instead of insta-stun, though, they inject chems on the targets that cause effects depending on concentration.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Boiler neurogas uses a similar system, transfering neurotoxin on unprotected victims.</li>

		</ul>

		</ul>
		<h3 class='author'>Surealistik updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='experiment'>B18 armor fully reworked. Gains an automedical system replacing the crappy tricordrazine autoinjectors, that doses the wearer when it detects injuries or pain. The bodyparts covered will also stabilize broken bones while worn. An integrated health analyzer is included for self-scan at no delay. The grenade belt holds double the amount than before.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class='author'>Dalek updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='imageadd'>Adds flechette ammo boxes.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2 class='date'>16 November 2018</h2>
		<h3 class='author'>LaKiller8 updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='tweak'>Command headsets regain MP channel. All channels start enabled.</li>
			<li class='rscdel'>Age no longer determines your success chances in rolling a job.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Mentors reworked into a more low-stress rank. Less access, less responsibilities.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class='author'>Surrealistik updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='rscadd'>Scout  thermal cape's cloaking now features a depleteable energy counter instead of a fixed duration; when energy reaches 0, the cloaking ends. Cloaking initially grants 95% transparency for a short duration. This transparency is reduced to 80% while walking after a short delay, or 50% while running. Remaining still for 3 seconds will increase the transparency to 95%. Energy is consumed at a rate of 1 per tile walked, and 5 per tile ran. Energy is slowly restored at a rate of 5 once every every 2 seconds roughly while stationary. Most aggressive actions like melee attacks, throwing and shooting will cause the Cloak to 'shimmer' capping transparency at 50% for a short duration. While shimmering, energy consumption for movement is maximized.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>M4RA rifle substantially improved; it now has more accuracy, less falloff, less scatter, a slightly faster burst and can equip many more attachments like the barrel charger, extended barrel, laser sight, underslung shotgun and flamer.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2 class='date'>15 November 2018</h2>
		<h3 class='author'>LaKiller8 updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>

		</ul>
		<h3 class='author'>Surrealistik updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='tweak'>Added a 0.5 seconds delay for the LTB cannon.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class='author'>spookydonut updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='rscadd'>Barricades have a chance to block melee attacks from xenos based on their health.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2 class='date'>14 November 2018</h2>
		<h3 class='author'>Surrealistik updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='tweak'>Self-splinting is no longer RNG-based. It's a timed action instead, and medical skill matters.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2 class='date'>13 November 2018</h2>
		<h3 class='author'>Jalordon updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='tweak'>Bipods made to be able to be deployed anywhere, but give benefits not only on barricades but also on window supports. Slowdown is applied upon deployment.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2 class='date'>11 November 2018</h2>
		<h3 class='author'>Arachnidnexus updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='imageadd'>Beautiful new Prison walls and windows.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2 class='date'>10 November 2018</h2>
		<h3 class='author'>Alterist updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='imageadd'>Added lobby screens based on Valmoric's work and a memorial.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class='author'>Surrealistik updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='tweak'>Explosive pouches can hold rockets.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class='author'>Arachnidnexus updated:</h3>

		</ul>


		<h2 class='date'>07 November 2018</h2>
		<h3 class='author'>LaKiller8 updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='bugfix'>Queen is now rolled before xeno from everyone who has queen on, instead of just the available xenos.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Amount of starting monkeys reduced to 5, scales with player population like the requisition vendors.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class='author'>Surrealistik updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='tweak'>Carriers now have the Spawn Hugger ability, allowing them to increment their facehugger stores by +1 at the cost of a 10 second cooldown and 100 plasma. This should make multiple Carriers more viable, and allow them to be relatively independent rather than completely and wholly reliant on Ovi'ed Queens.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Sentry burst now customizable from 2 to 6 shots. Accuracy loss and scatter scale with the number of shots. Delay between bursts shots reduced to 0.1.</li>
			<li class='bugfix'>Sentry no longer tries to acquire targets it has no clear line of fire to.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Sentry now has an alert notification system that triggers while on when it detects a hostile, falls over, takes damage, is destroyed, or runs out of ammo.</li>
			<li class='rscadd'>Minisentries added. They  have 150 HP vs 200 HP of the standard sentry, have a lower knockover threshold of 70 damage vs 100, and generally have their maintenance actions (battery/ammo replacement) done twice as quickly.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Minisentries can be point bought from Engi vendors for 26 points, or be bought at Req for 80 requisition.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Minisentries have no manual fire mode; they are auto-fire only, and have a smaller burst ceiling than the standard sentry; 2-4 vs 2-6.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Minisentries can be folded up, or deployed from their folded state; this takes about 4 seconds. A folded Minisentry can fit on the back, or in a technician's backpack (which can now hold M56D and sentry parts).</li>
			<li class='tweak'>RPG Delay for the RPG increased from 0.5 seconds to 0.6 seconds for the rail scope, and decreased from 0.5 seconds to 0.3 seconds for any other attachment (or lackthereof).</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Hunter is now considerably more fragile and attacks more slowly. Further, Pounce's initial cooldown has been increased to 15 seconds declining to 10 at Ancient. In exchange he gains a new and improved Stealth mechanic, as well as slightly improved plasma regeneration.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>4 seconds after entering Stealth mode, the Hunter can make the following Sneak Attacks while Stealthed depending on intent:</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Ravager reworked, gains two new abilities (ravage and second wind) and one reworked ability (eviscerating charge), as well as the Rage mechanic. It gains rage stacks by performing melee attacks, which increase armor and speed, and power up its special abilities. Ravage allows to attack up to 3 adjacent foes and Second Wind spends all the rage to heal and regenerate plasma.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2 class='date'>06 November 2018</h2>
		<h3 class='author'>Surrealistik updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='tweak'>Backpack storage increased.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Engineer Backpacks can now store M56D and sentry parts.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Welderpacks given backpack space so more engineers actually wear them.</li>
			<li class='rscadd'>Medic backpack now has an integrated defibrillator recharge unit, complete with a high capacity power cell.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Dragging a defibrillator onto the medic backpack will transfer charge from the recharge unit to the defibrillator.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Dragging a power cell onto the medic backpack will replace the currently loaded power cell for the recharge unit.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2 class='date'>05 November 2018</h2>
		<h3 class='author'>Surrealistik updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='experiment'>Crusher gains a new ability: Crest Fling. This will fling a mob, (including friendly smaller Xenos) 3-5 tiles behind or in front of the Crusher, scattering up to 1 tile away. While on Harm intent, Crest Fling will throw the target in front of the Crusher, otherwise, it will throw the target behind the Crusher. Deals minor Brute and moderate Halloss damage to non-Xenos that scales with the distance the target was flung. Halloss damage ignores armour.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Stomp reworked. It now affects mobs within 2 tiles of the Crusher, dealing base damage equal to 1.5x the Crusher's base melee damage in Halloss and Brute.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Crusher rear/side armour reduced by 75% of its base armour, up from 50% of its base armour.</li>
			<li class='rscdel'>Husking from fire removed.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Tackling will always apply armor-ignoring Halloss damage (amount depends on caste/upgrade level; Frenzy increases this). Each unit of Halloss damage causes 1.5 units of pain that cannot be reduced by pain killers. If total pain exceeds 200, then a human will be instantly disabled for a significant duration; this is the primary mechanism by which marines can be captured.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class='author'>Rohesie updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='experiment'>Overwatch divided in four squad consoles and a main one.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Squad consoles set objectives, handle supply drops and the rail gun.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Main console can see and message all squads and handles the orbital canon.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Rail gun added, a little peashooter for SOs to pew-pew through lazes and orbital beacons. Weak, but at least it's one shot per minute.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Tactical binocular's laze can be observed by overwatches and used as a target for the orbital canon and rail gun.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Orbital Beacons repurposed. Xenos can put acid to destroy them, and they can be planted and removed. They have an integrated camera to allow overwatches to see through them and work as targets for the orbital canon.</li>
			<li class='bugfix'>Fixes a bug in where people who went to cryo appeared as dead.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Gibbed marines are now reported as FUBAR, not merely DEAD.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Tactical Lasers get slightly more informative names and an actual unique ID.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2 class='date'>04 November 2018</h2>
		<h3 class='author'>LaKiller8 updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='tweak'>Distress beacon rework: Lowers cooldown between beacons; counts all humans and xenos on the map (instead of only on the ship), if there's a similar number of humans and xenos, allows it to send a beacon; distress is now automatically launched in 60 seconds unless an admin intervenes (compared to being only launched when an admins decides so).</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class='author'>Surrealistik updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='tweak'>Plasma cutter can now also destroy most machinery/structures by default.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>While on fire, Xenos can no longer regenerate, benefit from pheromones, or emit them; they can still be remotely healed by the Queen.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Incendiary rocket and grenade made not shit; creates an area of flame, and ignites/deals initial burn damage to all caught in the AoE. Initial burn damage and fire stacks scale inversely with distance from epicentre.</li>
			<li class='rscadd'>New Medic Item: Medevac Beacon.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Use the beacon on a Medevac stretcher to link that stretcher to the beacon.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Plant the beacon by using it in any powered area (you can plant it in an unpowered area but it won't function as long as that area is unpowered).</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Buckle a patient you want to evac into the Medevac stretcher, then use the Activate Medevac Displacement Field verb to teleport the patient to your linked beacon after a 5 second delay. A linked beacon must be planted in a powered area to be teleported to in this way.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>After successfully teleporting your patient, the Medevac Stretcher's bluespace engine requires 5 minutes to recharge.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Medics and SLs can lock/unlock a beacon by swiping it with their ID.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Part of this essential Medic kit breakfast.</li>
			<li class='experiment'>Additional Medevac + beacon kits can be ordered by Req for 100 points each.</li>
			<li class='wip'>Facehugger/Carrier Tweak</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Facehugger knockout time reduced to 10 seconds down from 30.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Facehuggers no longer knock off helmets for EZ decaps (they still damage hugger resistant helms such that they can no longer block huggers). If you're afraid of camera helms, huggers knock them out when they successfully face fuck someone. You can also use your ability to knock out lights so that their non-NV lenses can't see shit.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Compensation: Carrier facehugger throw speed doubled. Facehugger throw cooldown decreased to 25 > 20 > 15 > 10 from 30 > 30 > 20 > 10.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Reduced Facehugger latency on direct hits with thrown Facehuggers.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Carriers can now vent crawl; this should help them be more offensive and help with weeding.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Facehugging someone now takes half a second; this should significantly curtail combat hugging.</li>
			<li class='wip'>Further Necessary Defender Fortify/Crest Defense Buffs</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Slight armor progression: 20 > 25 > 28 > 30 up from 20 > 20 > 25 > 25</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Slight damage progression at Elder/Ancient: 23-33 and 26-36 up from 20-35 and 20-35 respectively.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Cooldown for Crest Defense and Fortify halved; now 1 second down from 2.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Fortify armour bonus increased to +70 > 80 > 87 > 90 up from +60 at all upgrade levels.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Crest Defense armour bonus increased to +35 > 40 > 43 > 45 respective to upgrade level up from 30 flat.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Crest Defense now grants explosive resistance level 2 while active; this means stun times for explosives are halved, and the Defender can't be gibbed by explosives.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>HP pool reduced in compensation.</li>
		</ul>

			<li class='imageadd'>Even more new walls. Real eye-candy.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2 class='date'>02 November 2018</h2>
		<h3 class='author'>Surrealistik updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='tweak'>All rocket type projectiles now have max pen; that they could be 'deflected' was ridiculous.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>AP rocket damage significantly increased so it actually works as a T3/Crusher buster.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Rockets now have max accuracy so no RNG misses.</li>
			<li class='bugfix'>Explosive projectiles now collide properly.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Due to its increment in lethality, the rocket launcher now has a 0.5 second wind up before it can fire.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>LTB devastation tiles removed; in exchange, its direct hit damage is significantly increased, as is the number of heavy explosion tiles.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Tanks no longer damage damage from weak explosions, and take reduced damage from moderate explosions to help the viability of the LTB needed after stun locking/chaining were removed.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>All armour types except the snowplow which Jeser is working on are now viable, and provide 1 primary resistance (50%) and two secondary resistances (75%). Check code for details.</li>

		<h3 class='author'>Rohesie updated:</h3>
		<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
			<li class='tweak'>Synths are now de-whitelisted, just remember to set up your Synthetic name first, David.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Big Firearms rebalance:</li>
			<li class='tweak'>SMGs have their damage buffed, but also have higher falloff.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>The PPSh fires like an inaccurate and weak machinegun from hell. Not horribly effective, but can kill weak T1.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Pistol damage and accuracy buffed.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>The highpower automag now has the shooting speed and stunning effect of a slug loaded tactical shotgun, but much less accuracy and damage</li>
			<li class='rscadd'>Revolvers ammo and shotgun slugs have now a special effect: stagger and slow. The target won't be able to use special abilities (T1 and T2 only) and will get a tiny slowdown. Both for a small time.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Tactical shotgun has less accuracy and damage to avoid making it OP with semi-automatic staggerstun. The HG shotgun got extra accuracy and lower scatter, at the cost of firing speed.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Buckshot now has a little less falloff, but a little extra negative AP</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Flechettes damage and AP buffed, though they still spread.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Rifle regular ammo have been given a little extre penetration. Rifle AP ammo had damage lowered but penetration increased. Overall falloff is halved.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Bonus pointblank damage reduced a bit to weaken the buckshot meta.</li>
			<li class='tweak'>softed the wield delay: it will now retain the unwield stats until the delay ends and not simply fail. Added a busy icon for feedback</li>
			<li class='tweak'>Attachments reworked: Suppressor falloff reduced; Bayonet increases side of the gun; Extended barrel as well, but slighty reduces scatter; Smaller damage reduction for the recoil compensator; Quickfire shooting speed reduction halved; Mag harness doesn't reduce accuracy anymore; Scope increases the burst delay and wield delay; Mini-scope has a smaller burst delay; stock no longer lower the fire rate, but inscrease wield delay; bipod greatly reduces burst spread, doesn't slow the rate of fire and is more intuitive to use but has considerable wield delay and increased weapon size.</li>
			<li class='wip'>Extra projectiles now have a scatter chance. Buckshot is still 100% as before, flechettes are 80%.</li>
			<li class='bugfix'>Removed two errors which were preventing attachments from affecting falloff damage.</li>
			<li class='bugfix'>Fixed Marksman ammo having negative AP.</li>
			<li class='bugfix'>Pointblank now works on Queen and crushers.</li>
