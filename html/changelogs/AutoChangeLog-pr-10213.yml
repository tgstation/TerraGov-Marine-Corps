changes: 
  - code_imp: "Refactored a bunch of fire-related things (DoT, fire stack additions, some weapon special effects, Ignition) to care about percentile fire armor (aka soft armor) instead of it not mattering in many cases."
  - balance: "Xenomorphs, when NOT on fire lose one fire stack per life tick, counteracting the prospect of non-igniting events adding firestacks having too much of an impact on subsequent ignitions, provided sufficient time inbetween."
  - bugfix: "Throwing resin jello as hivelord should be less likely to not have an impact now, due to a previous possible race condition."
  - balance: "Flamethrower fire intensity has been increased by 30% to counteract armor being taken into account. Other weaponry making use of incendiary effects unaffected."
