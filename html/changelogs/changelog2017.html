<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>November 17 2017</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>Rahlzel updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li>Requisitions revamped:</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Attachments, ammo, explosives, pouches, beacons, (and a few other categories) have been split up into item-specific crates to more easily manage orders.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>New "Attachments" category.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Moved explosives to Weapons category.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Moved empty sandbags to Operations category.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Lots of new crates added, including "Anesthetic crate" (4x masks and tanks) and "Quickclot crate" (14x Quickclot autoinjectors), per suggestions via Gitlab.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Many crates show the contents in the ASRS console for ease of use (though some are missing or too complex to list). The "xY" (x2, x5, etc) is meant to show the total number of that item, not the number of containers. For example, the "Body Bag crate" comes with 4 boxes of body bags, but each box has 7 body bags, therefore the ASRS console shows "x28" body bags instead of "x4" boxes.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Many prices have been adjusted but are subject to change as we continue to improve balance.</li>
	</ul>

		<li class='rscadd'>The Overwatch console now lets you transfer marines to another squad, report marines for insubordination (making them 'wanted' by the MPs), and assign a marine as squad leader even if they're not originally a squad leader. Changing the Squad's leader demote the current one if they're alive (demoted to their previous role if they were promoted to SL via overwatch console). A field-promoted SL gets automatically demoted and replaced by the squad's true SL if they join mid-round.</li>

		<li class='tweak'>Xeno's tail attack is now an action button.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Drone and Hivelord get the transfer plasma ability again. You now activate the ability like Pounce, select the ability and click a target to transfer a fixed plasma amount to another xeno at a certain range after a small delay. Hivelord transfers more plasma, at longer range, and faster.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Secrete Resin is now an active ability, like Pounce, it uses shift click or middle click. Hivelords can now secrete resin on tiles adjacent to them. They can also upgrade existing resin structures to their stronger version if it exists. Hivelord's Secrete Resin cost is increased.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Xeno abilities are now using action buttons, just like items like marine armor light. Most of those abilities are removed from the Alien tab in the top right corner, which means no more macro with those abilities. Some of those abilities can now be selected via their button and then used using middle click or shift click (Pounce, Stomp, Spit, Charge, etc). The 'secrete resin' ability is now split into two: 'choose resin' to select which type of resin structure you want to secrete, and 'secrete resin' to actually build that structure. Secreting resin now takes time, something around 1 second (and less for the Hivelord). Toggling dark vision is now a button next to the health and plasma. </li>
		<li class='tweak'>Praetorian's sticky resin spit is no longer its own ability but is now a different type of spit. It's also changed from a 3x3 sticky resin coverage to a single tile but the cooldown is reduced accordingly.</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>Weapon attachments can now be reloaded. The masterkey shotgun needs shotgun buckshot, the underslug grenade launcher needs M40 HEDP grenades, and the mini flamethrower needs  a flamethrower tank.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Using those attachment is no longer 'single use', i.e. if you fire the mini flamethrower once you're no longer automatically switched back to the main weapon. However if the attachment is empty and you try to use it you're automatically switched back to the main gun.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>To reload those attachments: if detached you simply click it with the appropriate ammo, if attached to enable the attachment and click the gun with the ammo. Beware: you can no longer reload the primary gun with those attachments toggled on. You can now see exactly how much ammo is left in the attachment by examining the gun it's attached to.</li>

	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>Various sound-related verbs in the Preferences (everyone) and Fun (Admins only) tabs have been improved:</li>
		<li><u>For all players</u> - Admin midis can still be permanently turned on/off via the Character Setup screen (or in Ghost > Edit Characters if you're observing). However, if you have admin midis enabled and an Admin plays a sound, you can use the new <b>Silence Current Midi</b> verb in the Preferences tab to forcibly stop hearing it. Additionally, a message is sent to staff when a player uses this verb within 30 seconds of a midi playing, letting us know that a player has silenced it. This is to give us a better idea of which sounds/midis are favorable over others. The goal is to improve immersion by teaching staff to play immersive, favorable songs and sounds while the game is played. For this reason, we're hoping those of you with Admin midis turned off will now turn them on in your Character Setup screen in order to take part.</li>
		<li><u>For Staff with the Fun tab</u> - "Play Global Sound" and "Play Local Sound" have been replaced by <b>Play Imported Sound</b> and <b>Play Sound From List</b>. The former will allow importing any sound from anywhere on your computer and then tells all connected clients to download and then play it (the way "Play Global Sound" used to work). The latter will display a list of server sounds and music that are already in the project and do not need to be downloaded by anyone. Obviously, "Play Sound From List" is preferred, and this can and will grow as we add more immersive music to the project (within reason - we don't want gigabytes worth of music). Both verbs now have "Global" or "Local" as secondary options when playing a sound, and both will show how many players are hearing it.</li>
		<li class='soundadd'>Also, Power Loader footstep sounds are now much more accurate.</li>

	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='experiment'>Added self destruct sequence and a new evacuation system.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Escape pods can only leave during evacuation. Only three people allowed per escape pod, and the pod won't launch if there are more than three.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>To toggle the evacuation, the distress signal must be launched and the ship must be in red alert. The option will then become available in the communication console. The self destruct console unlocks in the secure core room following this. You only have a few minutes to board the pods before they begin their automatic takeoff.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>To trigger the self destruct you must interact with the console and then wait for several rods to come out of the ground. Interact with each rod to arm it, then interact with the console again to trigger the destruct. The sequence takes around 20 minutes.</li>

		<li class='tweak'>False walls have been restored, along with everything associated with girders - metal needed returned to 2, time to build a wall returned to 8. Thanks for the constructive criticism (https://cm-ss13.com/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=12048). We'll look into some good alternatives and in the future disable false walls at the same time as having a good replacement.</li>
	</ul>

<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>2 April 2017</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>Rahlzel updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='tweak'>When players come to a locked airlock, most of the time they'll just deconstruct the wall beside it since the airlock itself takes some time to hack and deconstructing the wall only takes 2 quick steps - welder and wrench. We're changing this to be more in line with realism and, as a bonus, making Squad Engineers more useful as airlock hackers. As a result several things have changed:</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Normal (non-reinforced) walls now take 7 steps to deconstruct them instead of 2. Deconstruction starts the same way - with a lit welder - and the wall can be examined during the entire process to visually see which tool needs to be used next to continue. This will help prevent wiki-checking during normal gameplay. Also note that damaged walls must be repaired first (also with a welder) before they can be neatly deconstructed. This will all happen automagically just by hitting a wall with a lit welder - it will either start repair or start deconstruction.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Wall building/construction has been made a bit tougher in order to balance the realism of it now taking longer to deconstruct a wall. Walls now use 5 metal sheets on a girder instead of 2, and the time it takes to finish construction has been increased from 8 seconds to 30 seconds.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>False walls have been removed. We debated this to some extent and ultimately came to the conclusion that an entire wall sliding in and out is not exactly canon or even realistic (it's also simply old Baycode that we just haven't dealt with yet). We are considering alternatives, however, such as a barricade "gate" that slides open and closed, or allowing marines to be more nimble by jumping over any barricade (including flipped ones) after a brief cooldown.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Unrelated, but noteworthy: The Chem Dispenser's access requirements are now working correctly, which means that Squad Medics no longer have access to them. The Chemist/Doctor/Researcher/CMO watching his or her Chem Dispenser getting raided each round can now feel useful again.</li>
		<li>Thanks to forwardslashN for assistance with the above, and to Artouris for the April Fools update yesterday. The ocean-biomed "Nostromo" and "Old Sulaco" maps were quite popular, so we'll keep them and run them once in a while for fun and nostalgia. For those new to the community, they are based on our original 2 maps that were our first ones several years ago. You can read more about them here: https://cm-ss13.com/wiki/History#Pre-Alpha_Maps</li>

	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>Overhauled fire, all fire based weapons now actually function like fire based weapons.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>M240A1 Incinerator Units have been removed from Spec vendors and placed into SL vendors. SLs are expected to distribute them to the squad. Two in each SL vendor, four tanks for each. These tanks come with their own special fuel and will no longer accept phoron. You can eventually subsitute it with welding fuel from fuel dispensers if you run out of the original fuel. Use unique action to light the flamer, and should handle like a regular gun for the most part.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Fire now catches both marines and xenos on fire if they stand on it. You can no longer run through it without taking any damage. Also fire will cause things to explode reasonably.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Updated fire sprites have also been put in for marines/humans.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed being able to lay down and use the MG nest in WO.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Added a manual eject option on a Med-Pod (right click the Med-Pod itself to see it) for when people get stuck in surgery.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Changed up WO Med-Pod timer due to it being too long for WO, should scale better, and minimum time spent in the pod is now 2 minutes instead of 4.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>WO secondary defenses have been changed to help prevent xenos beelining to the Outpost itself; Also prevent xenos from blowing up secondary line defenses from behind.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>AP ammo has been added in small amounts to the ABS Beacon supply drop that SLs get.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Med HUDs and welding goggles have been added to WO areas respectively to counter any issues with your custom loadout interfering with equipment.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Defibs have been added to WO medical.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Changed the spawn rates of xenos on WO, should no longer end any chance of marine victory at wave 13; should be more gradual until the expected final wave of 15.</li>

		<li class='tweak'>Defibrilators have been buffed significantly. Players dead within 5 minutes can be revived as long as the defibrilator has enough charges, and as long as the player didn't die from suicide, chestbursting, head removal or extreme damage. Defibrilators can be charged using the same rechargers that are used for tasers and stun batons.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Sulaco Chemistry has been moved to the deck below Medbay to replace the Cloning Lab, and Medbay has been altered as well. Body Scanners, blood packs, a recharger, and a welding tool for robotic limbs has been added.</li>
