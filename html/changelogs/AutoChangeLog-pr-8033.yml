  - rscadd: "Defile no longer injects larva; instead it purges all chemicals in the victim and deals toxin damage equal to half the total U of chemical purged from the victim's system multiplied by 2 for each unique xeno toxin in its system. The victim also exudes a cloud of blood red Sanguinal smoke that scales in size with the amount of toxin damage dealt in this way."
  - rscadd: "New Sanguinal toxin added; deals minor brute and bleeding each tick.  For each other unique xeno toxin in the victim's system, it will also deal minor damage of a corresponding type (Stamina for Hemodile, Toxin for Neurotoxin and Burn for Transvitox)."
