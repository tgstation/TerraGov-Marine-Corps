	<h3 class='author'>Neth Iafin updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='experiment'>Hit status is displayed on Flak hit/airburst. Sniper rifle works fine, you just have to be scoped with it, but its accuracy was tweaked up anyways.</li>

		<li class='tweak'>Reverted SMG damage falloff to old value.</li>

<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>December 26 2018</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>Neth Iafin updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='experiment'>This is part one of weapon rebalancing.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>Changed how stuff handled in backend on drop, unwielding, unzooming and movement.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Admins can now set human mobs to be competely immune to any stun weaponry. This should be helpful during antag events.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Wielding anything bigger than pistols Akimbo style penalizes accuracy more. PB is still unaffected.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>SMG normal bullet deals more damage than AP one.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Mateba deals more damage to compensate for PB damage reduction.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Significantly increased M41AE2 default accuracy. Significantly increased M41AE2's scatter and burst scatter.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Normal SMG and M41A (M41AE2 included) bullets now lose less of their damage over distance.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Greatly increased default M41A rifle damage. Normal rounds now deal much more damage than AP and can be useful against low-armored opponents.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Greatly increased speed of M41A normal rifle rounds. Slightly decreased speed of SMG AP rounds. Greatly increased speed of M4RA hi-velo bullet.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Flak sniper bullets now explode when near hostile dealing part damage to nearby mobs. Flak sniper bullets now have bigger flak radius.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Scopes now don't provide buffs when not scoped in. Reduced damage falloff when scoping (depending on the scope type). Removed burst size debuff. Scopes now decreses accuracy when not scoping. Delay between shots is stronger when scoping.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Miniscopes now allow slow movement while still scoping if you are not using Rocket Launcher. Scope shift increased so you see more to the side. Rocket Launcher scoping now takes time and this action is visible to others.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Rifle, Revolver and SMG stocks now have much smaller increase in fire delay. They also increase accuracy, reduce recoil and scatter much stronger than before. However they slow you down when twohanded and apply debuffs on accuracy, recoil and scatter while using weapon single-handedly</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Shotgun stocks are given the same treatment, making them useful when using slugs.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Secondary weapons no longer receive buffs/debuffs to damage from original gun.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Bipod can now only be deployed on barricades and flipped tables, and if you move it automatically retracts. Now, instead of what it did before, bipod reduces scatter on burst, increases accuracy and increases fire rate. When not deployed, bipod slows down fire rate a bit.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Bipod increases firing speed for M41AE2 even more than before turning it into portable mini-m56.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Bipod has much smaller debuffs when not deployed.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Before you had a chance to miss another human of your faction. Now an additional BIG chance to miss is given if that person of your faction is using WALK intent.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Buffed laser sight accuracy when using weapon one handed.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Increased range of underbarrel flamethrower by 1 tile. Requisitions now have few fuel tanks roundstart to spare.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Added collapsible m39 stock to requisitions. This stock can collapse in on itself removing most of the side-effects.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Removed bonus damage to point blank from any weapon unless target is lying or unconscious. Greatly increased pointblank damage to lying or unconscious targets.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Reduced upfront buckshot damage significantly. Greatly reduced it's damage falloff and scatter of secondary bullets.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Increased flechette armor penetration by a small amount. Increased flechette damage by a small amount.</li>		
		<li class='tweak'>Increased vertical grip's and supressor's accuracy bonus.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Stock Crate in cargo now includes a single M39 Paratrooper's stock.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>HPR crate now has 2 HPRs for the same price.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>ALERT:: Reduced grenade detonation time and detonation time variance by around 1 second.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>HEFA shrapnel now deal less damage but actually penetrate (a lot) of armor. This should reduce its marine killing potential while making it semi-useful against bunch of hostiles. It still can totally wreck groups of marines if misused, so beware.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Small buff to crusher armor, and a buff to crusher armor while charging.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>TEMPORARY UNTIL NEXT PATCH:: buffed smartgun's falloff and armor penetration to make it on par with other weapons until Awan finishes smartgun rework.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>TEMPORARY UNTIL NEXT PATCH:: Increased power of xeno upgrade speed, but it starts to taper off almost instantly.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class='author'>ThePiachu updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='experiment'>Xenomorph can now purchase Mutator Flaws. You can only buy one Flaw, it gives you some points back, and acts like an inverse of the appropriate Boost.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Added Keystone Mutators. You can have only one Keystone Mutator (one for individual, one for Hive). Those generally define your xeno.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Added "Acid-tipped claws" mutator. For acid castes, it turns some of your slash brute damage into burn damage.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Hivelords spawn wider weeds by default (as if they purchased "Faster Weeds" for free). They can upgrade them further as needed.</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>Added a new Hive mutator - "Resilient larva". It boosts larva gestation speed and gives you a small chance of spawning an extra larva from (almost) all types of hosts.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Mutators have been disabled for Whiskey Outpost.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>The maximum larva that can burst from a single human has been reduced from 7 to 4. A 4-larva burst still gibs the host.</li>

<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>December 6 2018</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>ThePiachu updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='experiment'>First part of the Xeno Overhaul, the Xeno Mutators, is here!</li>
		<li class='experiment'>Every xeno receives a few mutator points every maturity level they reach. They can spend them to buy various boosts to their stats and abilities. Those mutators are reset upon evolving.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>Queen can also purchase mutators for the entire Hive. Those work like individual mutators, except they apply to all xenos of that Hive (and stack with individual mutators). The Hive gets more mutator points as the Queen matures. If a Queen dies however, those mutators are reset.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>This is a major experimental feature, expect things to be bugged, imbalanced, etc.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>When Queen dies, Xeno leader status is removed.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Boiler's gas radius is a bit smaller, but scales up with age.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Implemented #3774 - PFCs can now buy a (limited) amount of extras in their gear vendor. This should alleviate Requisitions a bit, plus bring a bit of joy to PFCs' lives.</li>

	</ul>
	<h3 class='author'>ThePiachu updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='tweak'>Multiple Hives are now handled individually and equally. This should tweak things slightly for XvX.</li>

	<h3 class='author'>Deanthelis updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>Implemented the CO rework.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>USCM rank structure has been adjusted. See the wiki page for details.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Changed the 'Commander' role to 'Commanding Officer'. Whitelisted COs are Captains, while CO Council members are Commodores. There is no mechanical difference.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Improved SO Policing skill so they can use a flash.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>All Department Heads have at least SO-level Leadership skill.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>The CO's (but not the XO's) headset grants access to the MP channel in addition to its previous frequencies.</li>

	<h3 class='author'>ThePiachu updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='tweak'>Fixes #3904 et al - xeno run, hide and intent preferences carry over upon evolution.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Xenos retain their plasma ratio when upgrading - this means if you were full before upgrading, you will remain full!</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Implemented #1154, #2699 - Ghosts can see Hive Status now.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Xenos will now retain their language knowledge on evolution and upgrades (watch out for Tradeband speaking Queens, they are up to no good...).</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class='author'>RavingManiac updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='experiment'>Bullet scatter now works by deviating the angle of the bullet, instead of having a random chance of the bullet targeting an adjacent tile.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>In burst fire, the first bullet is unaffected by burst scatter, with burst scatter being added with each subsequent bullet.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>SMG scatter is less affected by burst fire and one-handed firing than before.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Dual-wielding SMGs has penalties less than dual-wielding larger weapons, but still more than dual-wielding pistols. Probably still impractical.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Burstfire adapter does not increase scatter beyond the inherent scatter from a larger burst size.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed the secondary tile of some multi-tile doors not changing opacity properly.</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>The alpha version of WO is in the code. It is currently resctricted and staff should not be trying to do a WO round without prior approval from the dev team.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Latejoining is now possible on WO until wave 1. (12:15 on a normal WO round.)</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Wave 1 through 6 are mostly weak xeno’s they have reduced health. The lower the wave the less health.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Wave 7 is a break wave. A special ert gets called during this wave. (Only observers get notified so people dont ghost for ert.)</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Wave 8 until 12 are to ramp it up. This is where xeno's are expected to consistently make breaches.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Wave 13 is where the stuff to overwhelm marines starts.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Wave 15+ are randomly chosen from several presets. These waves can be smaller and strong or just ancient runner madness.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>There is a random amount added as overtime this is a maximum of 30 minutes. (45 min is very hard for the xeno's unless they stomp very early.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>If there is too many xeno's the wave gets delayed.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>This does not increase the amount of times marines have to hold out.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>So, this means that Xeno's get one less wave. And the wave lost will be at the end so a strong wave will be lost.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>This is why it is benificial to throw yourself at the cades. You can wait for evo or recovery but getting a new xeno will be quicker.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Because of WO we also have a special new marine ert.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Added in a verb for staff to lose their larva protection. They no longer have to deadmin to become a larva just press the button. Staff has to do this for every of their ghosts. So if you ghost back into your body use the verb again.</li>

		<li class='experiment'>Added phase 1 of the gameplay overhaul, objectives.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>Objectives are quest-like goals that players can complete during a round, currently the only reward is bragging rights on marines getting a higher score at round end.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>Currently there are 4 main types of objectives, finding and reading documents, retrieving disks for upload, uploading data from terminals, retrieving items.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>Added a new computer lab to the Almayer, next to the AI room, where you can upload disks and store retrieved items.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>Additionally there are 'meta' objectives like "Minimise marine losses", "Retrieve KIA marines", "Rescue the survivors", "Recover colonist bodies".</li>
		<li class='experiment'>There is a new IC tab verb called "View-objectives-clues" which will show any clues you personally have gathered, such as passwords or locations of objectives. I recommend checking it often as it will automatically hide objectives that have been completed by you, or more importantly, by others.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>During Phase 1 objectives will not affect win/loss or round ending earlier/later as players try them out on a large scale and additional objective types are added. Phase 2 or 3 will be to transition from wipe out the other side completely to achieving a set value or key objectives.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>Future phases will also begin layering in Research update elements as well as rewards for completing objectives and penalties for failing important ones.</li>

		<li class='tweak'>Barricades are no longer magical, and can block bullets both ways. The closer the shooter is to the barricade, the more likely his shot will pass. Shot accuracy improves the chances of passing the barricade. Clicking on the barricade itself will always hit it. Otherwise, shots fired while standing on or next to the barricade tile will always pass, and sniper rifle bullets will always pass.</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>The Orbital Cannon now exists physically on the Almayer, in the Weapons Room west of the CIC. It now needs to be manually loaded by Maintenance Technicians in order to be fired. You have the choice between three warhead types, HE, Incendiary, and cluster. After loading a warhead you must load solid fuel blocks in the exact amount required by the warhead (values randomized each round). You can check the fuel requirements of each warhead types on the OB console. The Orbital Cannon is still fired from the Overwatch consoles but the cannon needs to be loaded and chambered first. Once the cannon is chambered you cannot unchambered it and are forced to fire it to empty the barrel, so be careful when you load the cannon. The Orbital Cannon cooldown is now linked to the cannon itself rather than each marine squad, this means you can no longer fire one OB for each squad in a quick succession. The cooldown has been reduced accordingly. The overwatch console shows the status of the orbital cannon. Warheads and solid fuel blocks are transported and loaded with a powerloader. The MTs now have access to the Weapons Room west of the CIC. They can access it via the Maintenance hallway in the southern Missile Tubes room, you can also use the ladder that used to be in the lower deck brig, which is now in the brig's maintenance hallway. A new elevator is next to that ladder so powerloaders can be moved between the two decks.</li>

It is used in combination with medic's medevac stretcher to evacuate a wounded marine or a marine in a cryobag to the Dropship. The Medevac works as follows: a medic unfolds their medevac stretcher in a non-underground location on the planet, they buckle a marine or a bodybag/cryobag to the stretcher, they activate the stretcher's beacon via rightclick and wait. The dropship pilots now fly their dropship in 'flyby' flight, when in the air they use their console to select an activated stretcher, then they must go to the back of the dropship and click the Medevac System to activate its winch that will grab the stretcher, deliver its content to the dropship and drop the stretcher back to its original spot. The Medevac System has a cooldown of 1 minute between each use. Only Pilots can use the Medevac System, and only medically trained personnel can activate the stretcher's beacon.</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>Carrier's hugger mechanic is modified. Using the Throw Hugger ability now puts a hugger in your hand if it is empty. If you have a hugger in hand it throws that hugger. You can directly store a hugger by using that ability on a hugger on the ground next to you. Carrier can now pick up huggers normally like drones. Clicking a hugger in your active hand stores it.</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>The Xenomorph Queen gameplay is overhauled. You no longer click an ability to lay eggs, you now use an actual ovipositor. The "lay egg" ability is replaced by a "grow ovipositor" ability. Once your ovipositor is grown you cannot move and your abilities changes. The Queen now passively lay eggs and those eggs must be picked up and planted on weeds by the hive castes (Drone, Hivelord, Carrier, Queen). The planted eggs start already grown. The Queen gains new ability when in egg laying mode. She can toggle a wider vision mode and she can overwatch a xenomorph. The Queen pheromones are stronger and affect all xenomorphs when in egg-laying mode. The Queen can detach herself from the ovipositort. After that, the Queen must wait 5 minutes before being able to grow a new ovipositor. The Xenomorphs evolution progress stop when the Queen is not in egg-laying mode.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>All zoom modes no longer change your HUD to the 'reduced' mode.</li>
