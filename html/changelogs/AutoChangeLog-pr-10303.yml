  - balance: "LZ, Colony, and Armored Floodlights have had their lighting power (inverse dropoff) reduced. This means less lighting around the edges of floodlights but will now appear more circular in lit area."
  - balance: "LZ and Colony Floodlights have had their lighting range improved to compensate for increased dropoff in light."
