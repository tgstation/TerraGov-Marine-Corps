  - rscadd: "Spawning pools. They are randomly generated in caves, and each one will generate 0.5 larva points every minute. You need 8 points for a new larva. The number of spawning pool generated at start depends of the number of players, and they only spawn larva after shutters are opened"
  - rscadd: "Psychic points. Queen and shrike can corrupt generators (10 in each map), marines can remove that corruption using a welder"
  - rscadd: "Spawning pools can be constructed using psych points (900 points, wich corresponds to 30 minutes with 10 generators).
You are given points to build pools at starts, depending on the number of players on the server
Special pool can be built when hijack, the spawn rate of this upgraded pool is linear with the number of marines alive. Psych points are resets to 900 when hijacking, so you only get one and the other are destroyed when launching alamo"
  - balance: "Marines have a new objective: if they kill all the pools, xenos have ten minutes to build another one or they lose."
  - rscdel: "Headbiting is gone"
  - rscdel: "Voring is gone"
  - rscdel: "Silos are gone, you can't silo bodies to gain larva"
  - tweak: "Passive larva generation when marines are joining the game only works when shutters are closed, after that spawning pools are starting"
  - tweak: "Xenos can't grab dead humans anymore, only living ones"
  - imageadd: "Spawning pool sprite, stole from cimex sprite"
