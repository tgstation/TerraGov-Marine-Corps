  Rohesie:
  - balance: Crusher charge/crushing heavily refactored. There should be some differences
      in behavior, such as being able to break more things, dealing more consistent
      damage to objects (thus no longer deleting some and being stopped by others).  Interaction
      with crushing mobs also changed, should do a bit less damage and have an easier
      time plowing through them.
  - balance: Xeno bump delay removed. If xenos want to escape bodyblocking from smaller
      creatures (such as humans), all they need is to do is be on help intent.
  grinkgo:
  - rscadd: Real green beret added to custom loadout.
  - bugfix: Fixed the name of the TGMC beret in custom loadout. It's definitely not
      green.
