  by Surrealistik:

      amount of Hyperzine you have in your blood. Hyperzine causes you to lose nutrition
      in proportion. When all Hyperzine is metabolized, you then take oxy and halloss
      damage in proportion to the length of time it's been in your system. This can
      be fatal. Hyperzine still causes heart damage on ODs, and randomly. OD remains
      6, crit OD remains 10
  - tweak: Ultrazine speed boost nerfed.
  - tweak: Bipod removed for contributing too much to marine defense/stalemates. Gyro

      from TGMC have far outpaced the total supply of crayons produced by the entire

  LaKiller8:
  - code_imp: Preferences code has been made much better now. As a side effect you
      will have to set all of your preferences again because I was not able to sensibly
      convert that mess. The defaults should also be better for all players (no more
      Queen and Survivor on default).
  - bugfix: Defiler should now display on the hive status properly.
  - bugfix: Xeno tunnels now link properly.
