      marines can remove that corruption using a welder
  - rscadd: Spawning pools can be constructed using psych points (900 points, wich

      its current cooldown resets.
  - balance: Each time you clear Evasion's cooldown by dodging damage, the amount
      of damage you must dodge to clear its cooldown increases by 100% of the base
      amount. This increase is cumulative and resets when its cooldown clears normally.
