      of the minigun from 0.3 seconds to 0.2 seconds. Decreased wind up time of the

  - tweak: Walk mode made severely faster, and the default for humans. They can run
      by making use of a stamina buffer, which they recover when not running. Synths
      don't have stamina, so they cannot sprint/run but are unaffected by stamina
      damage.

      perfect while walking and only 80% when running. Their tackles now  fullyrespect

      same as xeno tackles, resin spit and a few other things.

      and alt+click on a turf near you. Alt defaults to run-while-holding, and you
      can shoot or attack while doing so. You can rebind it as well.
  - balance: The hunter is now much faster while stealthed, so as a consequence its
      sneak attack has been nerfed some. Probably needs further tweaks.
  - rscadd: Marines are allowed to respawn after a certain time dead. We'll see how
      this goes.

      at close range.

      used.
