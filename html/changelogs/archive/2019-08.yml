2019-08-25:
  Compadre Sonoliento(sprites) Kuro(Idea) MetroidLover(Editing and recoloring sprites):
  - imageadd: New B18 sprites with a darker look and glowing colored visor
2019-08-26:
  Rohesie:
  - rscadd: Reworked projectiles to use pixel movement (but not collisions, those
      are still tile-based), tracking the clicked pixel (unless a mob is clicked,
      in which case it will aim for the center of the target's tile for maximum accuracy,
      or unless scatter happens) in a straight line. For most bullets (rifles, SMGs,
      pistols, revolvers) the difference will be subtle at best, given how fast they
      are. It is more noticeable in tasers. For lasguns and faster projectiles the
      moving animation is outright disabled.
  - bugfix: Fixed a speed inconsistency of old projectiles, which would make bullet
      speed lower if you clicked closer to your own sprite.
  - balance: Tweaked accuracy to make the calculations a bit more sane. This may impact
      on it as reproducing the exact same behavior is hard, but it can be more easily
      adjusted now.
  - balance: Once a sniper acquires a target through its laser market it will no longer
      need to click on it to aim it. Any shots while active will be auto-targeted
      to it.
  - balance: Projectile speeds reduced all round the board. Xeno projectiles are slow,
      so you can see them traveling. Non-slug shotgun shells are slow and more visible.
      Slugs and regular bullets are fast, and hard to see. Sniper bullets and lasers
      are very fast, and even harder to see.
  - balance: Scatter is now angle-based, so it doesn't matter if the target (where
      you click) is near or far. Maximum scatter is 45 degrees in either direction.
      Extra projectiles (additional buckshot and flechettes) have a smoother, less
      random scatter, firing in a cone.
  - balance: Smartgun slowdown while wielded increased some to make it more defensive
      and less mobile..
  psykzz:
  - balance: (Crash Only) Xenos now start with the first tier already unlocked.
  - balance: bullets are now able to pass the fog barriers
2019-08-28:
  Rohesie:
  - balance: Xenos with devoured hosts can no longer cross the fog.
  psykzz:
  - rscadd: Marines lose when leaving without a nuke set on crash
2019-08-30:
  Ghommie:
  - bugfix: Patches up an issue with storage items and cryo. No more loadsa pills
      cluttering your stored items list, empty pill bottles, MREs etcetera.
  psykzz:
  - rscadd: message to the xenos when crash nuke is set.
2019-08-31:
  Rohesie:
  - rscadd: Girders reworked. Wall construction formula tweaked. Marines can build
      reinforced walls now.
  - tweak: Structure hitchance tweaked. The direction they are facing matters once
      again (barricades, flipped tables). Even unflipped tables and window frames
      have a chance, though lower, to stop bullets. Accuracy modifiers, distance between
      shooter and obstacle, and effective accuracy range of the bullet all affect
      it.
  - bugfix: Windoors no longer block lasers.
  - rscadd: You can now repair beat-up barricades you couldn't before by adding two
      sheets of metal/plasteel to them and then welding them.
