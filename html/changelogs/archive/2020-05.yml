  Pariah919:
  - rscadd: T-90 SMG added. A new T-19 sprite.
  - rscdel: T-19 Holster shouldn't be aquireable from anywhere from req. It's pointless.
  - tweak: Stuff that used to drop T-19s now drops T-90s. Please tell me if anything
      saying it should be a T-19 drops a T-90.
  - balance: Adds the T-90 smg and rebalances the T-14 to be more of a machinepistol
      style weapon. Check 4079 for changes on github. Main changes are the addition
      of the new smg and the T-19 is made to be more useable one-handed. Though you
      might need the stock to make it your primary.
