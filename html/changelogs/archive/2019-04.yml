  - imageadd: Fixes revolver sprite
  Hughgent:
  - rscadd: knife attachments
  JJRcop:
  - rscadd: SDQL2 now features a list constructor that takes a selector query.
  - tweak: The MAP statement will unwrap lone lists that are the only result. This
      means the parent query begins directly iterating over the list rather than a
      list that contains the list.
  Jalordon:
  - bugfix: Leader pheromones now function again while the queen is ovipositored
  by Surrealistik:
  - balance: ERT reinforcements now scale in proportion to the difference between

      cooldown changed to 3 seconds from 2.5.
  Rohesie:

      at half its maximum charge speed or higher.

      Barrel adjustment increased from +0.1 to +1. Suppressor adjustment decreased
      from -0.1 to -1.
  by Surrealistk:
  - tweak: Tunnel cooldown reduced from 4 minutes to 2. Tunnels are easier to destroy
      with grenades (2 frag grenades required). Tunnel travel time is now proportionate
      to distance between tunnels with a minimum travel time of 2 seconds, and a maximum
      of 4 or 6 for large Xenos.
  - tweak: If a tunnel is destroyed, its corresponding tunnel will also be destroyed.
  - tweak: Hivelords can dismantle their own tunnels by attacking them while on Harm
      intent.
  - balance: Hivelords may only have up to 4 tunnel sets in play at once (the current
      amount is displayed in the Status panel). Tunnel sets created beyond this amount

      surgical masks and gloves
  KitKetKetrai:
  - balance: Acid spit is now cheaper. Praetorians can spit acid longer, whilst spitters
      get lower plasma and regen to compensate. This should make it easier for drones
      and hivelords to keep spitters topped off.

      grab resist level by 1 until it exceeds the level of a grab, thereby breaking
      it.
  - tweak: 'Hunters gain armor penetration on stationary/stalk sneak attacks: 20%
      while on harm intent, and 50% while on disarm intent.'

      and slowdown stacks increased by 33% for stationary/stalk sneak attacks. Knockout
