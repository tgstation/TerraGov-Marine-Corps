  breadhunt, thank Elsa and Ciel for sprites:
  - rscadd: Marine CAS prediction matrix. A prediction for where CAS ammo will hit,
      before it arrives, now shows up on marine HUD.
  - imageadd: 'Various new CAS lase sprites, for:'
  - rscadd: CAS lase (flashing green dot) now has a sprite for each type of ammo fired
      (except HV GAU). Both xenos and marines see this.
  - balance: This means both marines *and* xenos can see what ammo's coming. Sorry,
      POs.
  - balance: Removed deviation from CAS flares
  - balance: Removed explosion from CAS flares and CAS smoke. Marines are finally
      safe
  - expansion: Complete fatty rework.
  - balance: Instead of a cluster explosion, fatty now destroys all walls in a 5 tile
      radius around impact.
  - balance: This is non-lethal; feel free to use it around brazilled marines. Point
      cost means you can't really spam it, however.

  - balance: crusher is no longer immune to some explosions
  - balance: crusher gets less damage from biggest explosions
