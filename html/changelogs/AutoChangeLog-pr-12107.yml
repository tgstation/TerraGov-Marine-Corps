changes:
  - code_imp: "Moved a lot of mob typechecks in evolution into being checked by bitflags."
  - code_imp: "Maximum checks for active caste and minimum amount of xenos and the death timer is now handled by variables on the caste datum, instead of the type of the mob."
  - code_imp: "Queen's death timers have been refactored into being applicable for any xeno base using the death_evolution_delay variable on the caste datum"
  - bugfix: "Fixes the evolution panel having N/A as the number when the xeno incapable of having evolution progress, as it was trying to divide by 0"
