changes: 
  - rscadd: "General circuits that can be adapted to a fire alarm, airlock or APC circuit with a multitool."
  - tweak: "Damage instances from acid puddles capped at 1 / second."
  - tweak: "Extended Barrel and RDS made slightly better for unwielded weapons. EB very slightly increases projectile speed."
  - tweak: "Suppressor very slightly decreases projectile speed, but its accuracy bonus has slightly increased for wielded and unwielded weapons."
  - tweak: "Laser Sight and Gyroscope made slightly better for wielded weapons (their benefits apply to them albeit at a lesser extent)."
  - tweak: "Barrel Charger slightly increases projectile speed."
  - tweak: "Accuracy penalties for BFA, wielded and unwielded, slightly reduced."
  - tweak: "M41A MK2 can now attach a recoil compensator."
  - tweak: "Extra buckshot spread reduced; max range increased to 10 tiles. This should make investing in buckshot accuracy worth a damn as it can be at least somewhat effective out to mid range now."
  - tweak: "Flechette spread slightly reduced as values were higher than intended per spread inherent to the shotgun."
  - tweak: "Supply packs updated: orders of 2x standard guns now come with 2 AP mags of the appropriate type. 1x HPR + ammo cost reduced to 20 points, and valu pack of 5 HPR + ammo costs 80 points."
  - tweak: "Neurotoxin projectile fire delays increased by +0.5 seconds across the board and progression smoothed out. Max range decreased to 10 tiles down from 15, and accurate range threshold decreased to 5 tiles down from 15, reducing its ability to off-screen; should still be very consistent at mid range."
