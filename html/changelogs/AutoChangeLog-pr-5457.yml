changes: 
  - tweak: "Evasion can now be forcibly cancelled by stagger, stun and other immobilizing debuffs."
  - tweak: "Burning now zeroes out Evasion stacks, and prevents their accumulation."
  - tweak: "Flamer direct hits now deplete Evasion stacks."
  - balance: "Evasion duration reduced to 2 seconds. Cooldown reduced from 30 seconds to 10 seconds. Plasma cost reduced from 20 to 10."
  - balance: "Evasion no longer has a cap on projectile damage it can dodge now; instead the user accumulates Evasion Stacks equal to projectile damage dodged while Evasion is active. If 120+ stacks are accumulated during the same Evasion duration, its current cooldown resets."
  - balance: "Each time you clear Evasion's cooldown by dodging damage, the amount of damage you must dodge to clear its cooldown increases by 100% of the base amount. This increase is cumulative and resets when its cooldown clears normally."
  - refactor: "Slow and stagger statuses partially refactored and standardized."
