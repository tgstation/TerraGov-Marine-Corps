changes:
  - spellcheck: "Organ health in health analyzers: \"Bruised\" -> \"Damaged\", \"Broken\" -> \"Failing\""
  - qol: "Health analyzers have had their chem contents and organ damage displays reworked. Chemical contents will display the estimated time until the chem metabolizes out, how close it is to ODing, and estimated time until it stops ODing (if it is ODing). Critical ODs are also labelled."
  - qol: "Organs that are halfway to Damaged status are now able to pop out on health scans if they aren't technically Damaged yet."
  - qol: "Limbs are color coded on health analyzers. Robotic limbs appear blue, while organic limbs change color based on their damage level, shifting from yellow (low damage) to red (high damage) as they take more damage relative to their maximum health before severing - low health limbs like extremities need less damage to be colored orange/red."
  - refactor: "Refactored how health analyzers handle data and auto updates. Loading screens won't occur when scanning somebody, auto updates take ~0.9s instead of ~2s and runtimes won't occur if a scan happens too fast."
  - qol: "You can now opt out of being shown your scan using a preference. Showing healthscans to people from other factions is no longer allowed. Showing healthscans to people has a 3 second cooldown."
  - bugfix: "Accessible TGUI themes preference is now saved."
