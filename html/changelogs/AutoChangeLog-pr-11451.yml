  - bugfix: "Fixed some bluescreens related to TGUI inputs."
  - bugfix: "Fixes a runtime with material containers."
  - bugfix: "TGUI now alerts the user when it is waiting on a refresh cooldown. In many cases, this will prevent screens from breaking that rely on static data."
  - bugfix: "TGUI static data loading screens no longer resize the window temporarily. Note: If you are using a UI that gets a lot of these, please make an issue report."
  - bugfix: "native fast gui boxes work again"
  - bugfix: "TGUI and Tooltip windows now work with high-dpi web browsers (People who are using Chromium through black magick or who have manually enabled DPI scaling for IWebBrowser2, or its already native due to byond updates ? idk)"
  - qol: "The reconnect button in tgchat will now reopen the game."
  - refactor: "Ping system of tgui-panel has been reworked, which fixes things mentioned below."

  - bugfix: "Manual reconnect should now work 100% of the time"
  - rscadd: "The accounting console has been added to the HOP's office, allowing them to track purchases, and bank balances of the crew on station. It's not illegal, it's the competitive advantage!"
  - bugfix: "renamed suffix for tgui-polyfill from bundle.js to min.js to prevent CBT failing after target 'clean'"
  - code_imp: "Prettier is now recommended as an extension for UI development (or just in general!)"
  - refactor: "Many, many interfaces have been hit with the prettier stick so please report any issues. There should be zero noticeable differences in how UIs look or function."
  - rscadd: "Examining and other chat outputs now display in blocks to make them easier to see"
  - bugfix: "AI and borgs no longer have their name show twice upon being examined"
  - bugfix: "Fixed \"Script Error\" in tgui and tgchat (hopefully)."
  - bugfix: "Multiline inputs can now finally support line breaks, accessible via shift-enter! A maximum of two consecutive line breaks is allowed, any more than that will be automatically stripped. This only applies to input boxes that start with the multiline view enabled, and will thus not work on input boxes that aren't meant to support it."
  - code_imp: "restrictedinput can now accept negative numbers"
  - qol: "the full window refresh time is now one second instead of five seconds"
  - bugfix: "refreshing windows (\"please wait...\") no longer hang for up to twice as long as they should"
