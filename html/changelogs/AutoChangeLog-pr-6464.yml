changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds structural support to LV caves; there are now indestructible rock walls in certain parts of the caves to prevent digging around the entire mountain, or making huge openings. Certain lanes, however, remain open for PC usage."
  - rscadd: "Adds several new flanks in all of the caves, while closing off others; far west and east caves are now less of a deathtrap for xenos AND marines alike."
  - rscadd: "Adds in a new, smaller bridge near west caves, and repairs all catwalks + bridges currently on LV."
  - rscadd: "Opens up a lot of grass areas, turning them to dirt so that Colony is not as bad to fight in. This includes around bridges to make them easier to fight around."
  - rscadd: "Adds in a few more flanks with dirt in Colony to give more choices for xenos, alongside more danger for marines."
  - balance: "Makes west LZ-2 into South LZ-2; it is now placed near where Engineering used to be."
  - balance: "Engineering is now moved near Caves, exactly where Tfort was. Tfort is no more."
  - balance: "Extended the caves near engineering and made another flank into caves which can be used by xenos to flank but can also be secured by marines to push into caves."
  - balance: "Adds a small amount of turrets around some of the new flanks."
