changes:
  - rscadd: "Runners now have a new HUD element that indicates Evasion's remaining duration. This updates in real time and is visible to all xenos."
  - rscadd: "Added Auto-Evasion. Right click or alternate use of Evasion toggles this on and off. While Auto-Evasion is active, it will automatically try to use Evasion again if you get the cooldown reset bonus."
  - rscdel: "Removed Toggle Savage. It has been merged with Pounce as its right click / alternate use, otherwise retaining its usual functionality."
  - qol: "Using Evasion again while it is active will extend its current duration instead of flipping the bird at you and making you wait until Evasion is over."
  - balance: "Pounce will now go through xenos."
  - refactor: "Minor code changes to Pounce. Moved it to Hunter's and gave Runner its own child ability with Toggle Savage."
  - code_imp: "Minor code changes to Evasion that remove unnecessary code and account for other changes."
  - code_imp: "Finishes deprecating a hardcore var that wasn't used anywhere."
  - bugfix: "Fixed a bug where using Pounce interrupted Evasion if it was active."
  - imageadd: "Evasion counter sprites. They suck. Please sprite something better, I beg you."
  - imageadd: "Small indicators on ability icons for visual feedback."
  - spellcheck: "Runner's caste description changed ever so slightly to look and sound better."
