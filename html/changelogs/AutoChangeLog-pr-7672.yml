changes: 
  - balance: "no more crash locations for canterbury that block the sides in a way that makes it impossible for Xenos to access."
  - balance: "made fogs for silos in crash that could be destroyed via glitching wider so now it will be impossible as marines should not be able to destroy them."
  - expansion: "3 new canterbury crash locations"
  - balance: "removes some rock walls to make new & old crash locations a bit more accessible."
