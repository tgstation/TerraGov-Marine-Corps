  - rscadd: "Xenos now get a location of a random human on the planet and ship, observers get both larvas on the ship and on the planet."
  - balance: "Reduces first Bioscan interval to 45 minutes, later it's every 20 depending on the amount of alive marines to alive xenos. Those can take from 5 to 30 minutes."
  - bugfix: "Random xeno location for the marines should now be displayed properly."
