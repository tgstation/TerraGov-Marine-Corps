      spread inherent to the shotgun.
  - tweak: 'Supply packs updated: orders of 2x standard guns now come with 2 AP mags
      of the appropriate type. 1x HPR + ammo cost reduced to 20 points, and valu pack
      of 5 HPR + ammo costs 80 points.'
  - tweak: Neurotoxin projectile fire delays increased by +0.5 seconds across the
      board and progression smoothed out. Max range decreased to 10 tiles down from

  - tweak: fusion engines are now generating more power and are less prone to fail.
  Spyroshark:
  - balance: Snipers now get twice as much ammo in their kit.

  - tweak: Advanced hyposprays now show as advanced hyposprays.
  by Surrealistik:
  - tweak: Hyperzine made decent. Now provides a speed bonus that scales with the
      amount of Hyperzine you have in your blood. Hyperzine causes you to lose nutrition
      in proportion. When all Hyperzine is metabolized, you then take oxy and halloss
      damage in proportion to the length of time it's been in your system. This can
      be fatal. Hyperzine still causes heart damage on ODs, and randomly. OD remains
      6, crit OD remains 10
  - tweak: Ultrazine speed boost nerfed.
  - tweak: Bipod removed for contributing too much to marine defense/stalemates. Gyro

      from TGMC have far outpaced the total supply of crayons produced by the entire

  LaKiller8:
  - code_imp: Preferences code has been made much better now. As a side effect you

      convert that mess. The defaults should also be better for all players (no more
      Queen and Survivor on default).
  - bugfix: Defiler should now display on the hive status properly.
  - bugfix: Xeno tunnels now link properly.

  - rscdel: Some old unmaintained objects, such as the turbines in big red reactor
      room, will no longer have any interactions. They are mainly thematic with their

      higher smoke radius. Careful of FF potentials.

      bucklecuffed you'll try to remove the cuffs, and if you succeed you'll just

      \ for everyone on the ship. Gold is for the ship crew (navy and attach\xE9es),\

      dead bodies in them anymore (and will spit out whoever dies inside them). You
      can now drag them even if closed, as long as they don't contain someone. They
      will no longer show the name of the person inside.
  psykzz:
  - balance: rebalanced boiler bombard, overall reduced 2 seconds from total time
      needed to fire, but also frontloaded most of the wait to toggling the ability,

      This works for pill bottles to make the medic life easier, ammo belts, and several
      other things.
  - balance: Shrikes can no longer ventcrawl.
  - balance: Bipods can be deployed anywhere (after a second-long delay), granting
      bonuses while deployed. It will auto-retract once the user moves, or drops or
      equips the weapon.
  - balance: Scatter reworked to be a bit more organic. Instead of a random adjacent
      tile it will take into account the pixel clicked on the tile and the shooting
      direction. The bullet can deviate several tiles (on edge cases, such as untrained
      dual-wielding on burst, even up to 4 or more).
  - balance: Suppressors, extended barrels, stocks, grips and recoil compensators
      provide a little better effect against scatter. Quickfire and barrel chargers
      a bit worse.

2019-08-25:
  Compadre Sonoliento(sprites) Kuro(Idea) MetroidLover(Editing and recoloring sprites):
  - imageadd: New B18 sprites with a darker look and glowing colored visor
2019-08-26:
  Rohesie:
  - rscadd: Reworked projectiles to use pixel movement (but not collisions, those
      are still tile-based), tracking the clicked pixel (unless a mob is clicked,
      in which case it will aim for the center of the target's tile for maximum accuracy,
      or unless scatter happens) in a straight line. For most bullets (rifles, SMGs,
      pistols, revolvers) the difference will be subtle at best, given how fast they
      are. It is more noticeable in tasers. For lasguns and faster projectiles the
      moving animation is outright disabled.
  - bugfix: Fixed a speed inconsistency of old projectiles, which would make bullet
      speed lower if you clicked closer to your own sprite.
  - balance: Tweaked accuracy to make the calculations a bit more sane. This may impact
      on it as reproducing the exact same behavior is hard, but it can be more easily
      adjusted now.
  - balance: Once a sniper acquires a target through its laser market it will no longer
      need to click on it to aim it. Any shots while active will be auto-targeted
      to it.
  - balance: Projectile speeds reduced all round the board. Xeno projectiles are slow,
      so you can see them traveling. Non-slug shotgun shells are slow and more visible.
      Slugs and regular bullets are fast, and hard to see. Sniper bullets and lasers
      are very fast, and even harder to see.
  - balance: Scatter is now angle-based, so it doesn't matter if the target (where
      you click) is near or far. Maximum scatter is 45 degrees in either direction.
      Extra projectiles (additional buckshot and flechettes) have a smoother, less
      random scatter, firing in a cone.
  - balance: Smartgun slowdown while wielded increased some to make it more defensive
      and less mobile..
  psykzz:
  - balance: (Crash Only) Xenos now start with the first tier already unlocked.
  - balance: bullets are now able to pass the fog barriers
2019-08-28:

  psykzz:
  - rscadd: message to the xenos when crash nuke is set.
2019-08-31:
  Rohesie:
  - rscadd: Girders reworked. Wall construction formula tweaked. Marines can build
      reinforced walls now.
  - tweak: Structure hitchance tweaked. The direction they are facing matters once
      again (barricades, flipped tables). Even unflipped tables and window frames
      have a chance, though lower, to stop bullets. Accuracy modifiers, distance between
      shooter and obstacle, and effective accuracy range of the bullet all affect
      it.
  - bugfix: Windoors no longer block lasers.

      sheets of metal/plasteel to them and then welding them.
2019-09-02:
  Rohesie:
  - balance: Crusher charge/crushing heavily refactored. There should be some differences
      in behavior, such as being able to break more things, dealing more consistent
      damage to objects (thus no longer deleting some and being stopped by others).  Interaction
      with crushing mobs also changed, should do a bit less damage and have an easier
      time plowing through them.

      creatures (such as humans), all they need is to do is be on help intent.

      in ovi mode, either by selecting the ability, selecting a xeno from the hive
      status list, or using ctrl + middle click. The ability stacks with the zoom,
      so they can provide more effective overwatch support and guidance. The leader
      pheromone bonus is kept even as the Queen moves.

  - tweak: Walk mode made severely faster, and the default for humans. They can run
      by making use of a stamina buffer, which they recover when not running. Synths
      don't have stamina, so they cannot sprint/run but are unaffected by stamina
      damage.

      perfect while walking and only 80% when running. Their tackles now  fullyrespect

      same as xeno tackles, resin spit and a few other things.

  - balance: The hunter is now much faster while stealthed, so as a consequence its
      sneak attack has been nerfed some. Probably needs further tweaks.

      at close range.
  - rscadd: Most attacks get an animation now. Attacking with items shows the weapon
      used.
  - tweak: The cryosleep machines only accept bodies that have been disconnected for

      the user accumulates Evasion Stacks equal to projectile damage dodged while

      its current cooldown resets.
  - balance: Each time you clear Evasion's cooldown by dodging damage, the amount
      of damage you must dodge to clear its cooldown increases by 100% of the base
      amount. This increase is cumulative and resets when its cooldown clears normally.
