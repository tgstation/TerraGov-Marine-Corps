      spread inherent to the shotgun.
  - tweak: 'Supply packs updated: orders of 2x standard guns now come with 2 AP mags

      of 5 HPR + ammo costs 80 points.'

      in that direction.
  - tweak: Ravage can now also hit more than three humans; the rage gained from hitting
      humans is still capped at 30 rage from hitting 3 humans

      cleared, buttons for the vault and science domes added to other areas, redid
      the pipes around the colony so xenos have more paths,  widened some areas so

      fuelled, some others are in derelict state, fuel cells are empty).'
  - tweak: fusion engines are now generating more power and are less prone to fail.
  Spyroshark:
  - balance: Snipers now get twice as much ammo in their kit.
  by Surrealistik:
  - tweak: Req supply pack for the ZX-76 Shotgun has been added.

  by Surrealistik:
  - tweak: Hyperzine made decent. Now provides a speed bonus that scales with the
      amount of Hyperzine you have in your blood. Hyperzine causes you to lose nutrition
      in proportion. When all Hyperzine is metabolized, you then take oxy and halloss
      damage in proportion to the length of time it's been in your system. This can
      be fatal. Hyperzine still causes heart damage on ODs, and randomly. OD remains
      6, crit OD remains 10
  - tweak: Ultrazine speed boost nerfed.
  - tweak: Bipod removed for contributing too much to marine defense/stalemates. Gyro
      removed because no viable alternative.

      from TGMC have far outpaced the total supply of crayons produced by the entire
      earth sphere. Rumor has it that TerraGov have turned to reducing the amount
      of crayons packed in MREs, and recycling old crayons, combining the previously
      separate color/flavours into one.
  - imageadd: Added new pizza, muffin, bacon, monkey meal, and chocolate bar sprite

      would be able to knock the floodlight in one hit !
  Rohesie:
  - balance: Warrior grab knockdown time reduced.

  LaKiller8:
  - code_imp: Preferences code has been made much better now. As a side effect you
      will have to set all of your preferences again because I was not able to sensibly
      convert that mess. The defaults should also be better for all players (no more
      Queen and Survivor on default).
  - bugfix: Defiler should now display on the hive status properly.
  - bugfix: Xeno tunnels now link properly.
  Rohesie:
  - balance: Xeno embryos no longer grow at all in mobs in stasis, be it cryo bags

  by Surrealistik:

  Spyroshark and Drawsstuff:
  - rscadd: Xenomorphs can now play basketball.
