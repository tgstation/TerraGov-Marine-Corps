      grilles.
  - rscadd: Attacking the razorwire in melee results in damage that is reduced by
      armour.

      getting entangled for 5 seconds, as well as an initial slowdown and additional
      damage on disentangling.

      if they hit it at maximum speed.
  - rscadd: Boiler acid damages the razorwire.

  - tweak: M41A MK2 can now attach a recoil compensator.

      effective out to mid range now.
  - tweak: Flechette spread slightly reduced as values were higher than intended per
      spread inherent to the shotgun.
  - tweak: 'Supply packs updated: orders of 2x standard guns now come with 2 AP mags
      of the appropriate type. 1x HPR + ammo cost reduced to 20 points, and valu pack
      of 5 HPR + ammo costs 80 points.'
  - tweak: Neurotoxin projectile fire delays increased by +0.5 seconds across the
      board and progression smoothed out. Max range decreased to 10 tiles down from
      15, and accurate range threshold decreased to 5 tiles down from 15, reducing
      its ability to off-screen; should still be very consistent at mid range.
