      spread inherent to the shotgun.
  - tweak: 'Supply packs updated: orders of 2x standard guns now come with 2 AP mags

      of 5 HPR + ammo costs 80 points.'

      upon hitting dense turfs.
  - tweak: Ravage no longer has a two tile range limitation for activating the ability,
      it will also no longer move you one tile in a direction. Using the ability will
      now make you face the general direction of the mouse and slice all nearly marines
      in that direction.
  - tweak: Ravage can now also hit more than three humans; the rage gained from hitting
      humans is still capped at 30 rage from hitting 3 humans

      cleared, buttons for the vault and science domes added to other areas, redid
      the pipes around the colony so xenos have more paths,  widened some areas so
      the tank have more venues of attack. Most important of all, Nexus now has a
      fancy logo on the floor

      at startup has been changed (enough engines to power the ship are powered and
      fuelled, some others are in derelict state, fuel cells are empty).'
  - tweak: fusion engines are now generating more power and are less prone to fail.
  Spyroshark:
  - balance: Snipers now get twice as much ammo in their kit.
  by Surrealistik:
  - tweak: Req supply pack for the ZX-76 Shotgun has been added.

  by Surrealistik:
  - tweak: Hyperzine made decent. Now provides a speed bonus that scales with the
      amount of Hyperzine you have in your blood. Hyperzine causes you to lose nutrition
      in proportion. When all Hyperzine is metabolized, you then take oxy and halloss
      damage in proportion to the length of time it's been in your system. This can
      be fatal. Hyperzine still causes heart damage on ODs, and randomly. OD remains
      6, crit OD remains 10
  - tweak: Ultrazine speed boost nerfed.
  - tweak: Bipod removed for contributing too much to marine defense/stalemates. Gyro
      removed because no viable alternative.

  Alterist:
  - tweak: Due to the overwhelming popularity of The New Crayon(tm) MREs, the demand
      from TGMC have far outpaced the total supply of crayons produced by the entire
      earth sphere. Rumor has it that TerraGov have turned to reducing the amount
      of crayons packed in MREs, and recycling old crayons, combining the previously
      separate color/flavours into one.
  - imageadd: Added new pizza, muffin, bacon, monkey meal, and chocolate bar sprite
  - imagedel: removed old food sprites
  - imageadd: changed boonie hat item sprite, fixed onmob sprite

  - rscadd: You can now repair broken floodlights using a quick procedure (open panel,
      weld, mend wires with wirecutters, close panel). Don't let the panel open, xenos
      would be able to knock the floodlight in one hit !
  Rohesie:
  - balance: Warrior grab knockdown time reduced.
  - balance: Neurotoxin chem gets metabolized quicker. Neurotoxin spit gets a 30u
      threshold.

  Alterist:
  - spellcheck: Fixed extra period on RO suit, MPs now wear uniforms instead of jumpsuits
  LaKiller8:
  - code_imp: Preferences code has been made much better now. As a side effect you
      will have to set all of your preferences again because I was not able to sensibly
      convert that mess. The defaults should also be better for all players (no more
      Queen and Survivor on default).
  - bugfix: Defiler should now display on the hive status properly.
  - bugfix: Xeno tunnels now link properly.
  Rohesie:
  - balance: Xeno embryos no longer grow at all in mobs in stasis, be it cryo bags

  - balance: Sentries on single fire gain +50% accuracy, damage and penetration.
  - balance: Minisentry bullet damage profile changed to 35/20 from 25/40. This should
      make it better at dealing with flanking castes.
2019-02-23:
  LaKiller8:
  - bugfix: IDs should no longer default to equipping in the helmet.
  by Surrealistik:
  - balance: A direct stomp hit wasn't doing intended damage; this has been fixed.

      checking if the user is incapacitated on certain actions.
  - bugfix: Portable atmos equipment isn't invisible anymore.
  LaKiller8:
  - code_imp: Map votes and changing along with pinging the New Round Alert role has
      now been automated.
  - rscadd: Most interfaces now use the pretty browser datum.
  Rohesie:
  - tweak: Unique-action (space bar) now reloads the smartgun. IFF is now toggled
      by alt+click
  Shadow-Quill:
  - bugfix: Hyperzine will no longer allow you to go under 0 nutrition.
  Spyroshark and Drawsstuff:
  - rscadd: Xenomorphs can now play basketball.
2019-02-25:

      members become Master At Arms. Medbay becomes more militarized, with Medical
