changes: 
  - expansion: "Marines get one HMG, it is harder to lug around than a TL-102, has no IFF, but it fires faster, and deploys slower. Better not lose it."
  - balance: "TL-102 HSG fires slower (0.25 fire delay from 0.2), added one cool HMG gun to the marine vendor. Better not lose it.
spriteadd: sprites for the MG08/495 and TL-102 while in your hand."
  - bugfix: "tl-102 and mg08 can no longer take any attachments."
  - qol: "minor reorganization of specialized tab in marine vendors"
