	<h3 class='author'>Rahlzel updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>Humans buckled into a nest will now have the option to break free at their leisure (after waiting for the nest resist timer in ~ 3 minutes) simply by using Resist one last time to pop up instantly. This allows for nearby humans to coordinate their escape or allow a single human to attempt escape when they think there aren't any Xenos around and they're good and ready. Also, if the human has been additionally secured by their hands and feet, they will be told this when the resist timer is up so they can plan ahead.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 class='author'>Infenrus44 updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>New Ice Colony map!</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>You can now toss grenades down the ladders. Take it in your hand, and click on the ladders and it will prime itself and teleport down/up the ladders</li>
		<li class='bugdel'>Removed Apophis's last commit as it makes no sense to have Tcomms tower if all you have to do is set up the engine and you don't have to take care of it ever again. Use pacman generators instead</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Many fixes, adjustments and resizes of the map during the past few days</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 class='date'>5 May 2016</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>Abby updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='bugfix'>Crushers shouldn't be able to phase through barricades anymore. It was not intentional.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed [redacted] not spawning with its tube of missiles/li>
		<li class='tweak'>Not enough guns! Abby need guns! Cargo passive point gain doubled, more points per crate!</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Ladders should no longer teleport things if you pull while laddering</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Xenos can no longer right-click-> pull tab on objects.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Carrier, Drone gain Secure Host</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Resincuffed people's sprites update correctly, I am really sorry about the god awful cuff sprites, SecretStamos will fix it soon I promise</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Xenos are slightly slower while pulling a mob.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Membranes can no longer be shot through or spat through, their layer was set too low. Don't worry xenos, you're getting some new barricades soon..</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Display messages for resisting out of nests</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Shotguns now have an alternate method of reloading: If you are carrying a box of shells of the same type that's already loaded, you can quickly top up the loaded one with the one in hand. It can be paused at any time as it feeds shells in, but you still can't load multiple varieties of ammo into the same mag.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Hopefully fixed the obnoxious bug with burst fire weapons jamming. Although I'm actually kind of enjoying it as a feature to be honest.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Underslung grenade "about to asplode" timer increased a bit, so there's a tiny bit more warning. Currently they're just much too hard to evade.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed some more misplaced attachment sprites.. But a lot still look like ass. If you have an attachment that you stick on and it doesn't look right, please post a small screenshot on the bug report forum and it'll be fixed that day probably.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Someone in the Armat labs has stabilized the M83 rocket fins, making it much less likely to whoosh on past a target. This does not apply to the [redacted] which is as OP as ever.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Effects of armor against projectiles increased slightly, though this has less of an impact (hah ha! Get it?) on AP rounds.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Marine combat boot damage absorption upped substantially, it was 6 times lower than marine gloves. wat.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>3 May 2016</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>Abby updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='bugfix'>Hopefully fire bug fixed with humans and xenos, from incendiary rounds. Hopefully.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed a few bugs with mercenary gun spawns</li>
		<li class='tweak'>No more need to field strip a weapon, just attach it and it'll drop the old slot item on the floor.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Underbarrel attachments no longer fit in backpacks or pockets.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Facehuggers dropped on a tile with more than 4 there already are cannibalized by the others.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Predators are no longer slowed down by cold, and their armor protects them better.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Aliens can no longer drag items. What you say! What! Holy moly! Yes, it's a big change. No dragging flares, lockers, facehuggers, etc. You can still drag mobs. MANY objects have been tweaked and changed slightly to ensure things remain fair for them -- draggable objects are all destroyable (such as vending machines) and some are no longer dense. You can no longer build some structures with metal, such as closets, and all lockers are now bolted to the ground. </li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Didn't think I was giving that away for free, did you? Most non-runner-caste xenos now get access to the Secure Host verb in aliens tab, which lets you spin resin on a nested host to secure them first with handcuffs, and then legcuffs which must be resisted out of to get free.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Riot shield chance to block slashes and disarms cut down.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 class='author'>Absynth updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>Holy crap new projectile system! You actually have to aim now. Learn firing angles. Practice! You'll find all kinds of new guns, the pathfinding is much better, the system doesn't lag us out. Wow! See the forums for a bunch of posts about it. New ammo! New attachables! Holy shit! Someone should write a guide so I can belittle its ignorance.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Hunter Games gamemode! Yay! This is something we bring out once in a while to keep things fresh and let people blow off a little bit of steam. Might be a good idea to keep a no-name character handy to play there. Like the gamemode? Don't like it? Voice your opinions on the forum! The way Hunter Games works is, you ready up, get spawned into LV624 amidst a huge pile of random stuff. Then you fight it out until there's only one left standing! The last survivor has their name kept in the server logs forever. Glory!</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Xeno HP has been nerfed slightly across the board. Some castes have had armor values increased to compensate, some had no HP nerf, and some got double whammied. Expect balance to be tweaked until I'm satisfied we can get maximum bloodshed from both teams. And don't fret, coming up next is the big xeno rewrite..</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Crushers lose a bit of stomp radius.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Bunch of cargo crates fixed with better stuff.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Predators are losing hellhounds for now, but are gaining new cool upgrades for their bracers, including a universal translator and a sick new wristblade. Expect to see and play hellhounds in the Hunter Games!</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Way way more! If you find new bugs please post them on the forums.</li>

		<li>Observer improvements in "Ghost" tab:</li>
        <li class='rscadd'>New verb: Follow Xeno. Shows a list of living Xenos that are playing.</li>
        <li class='tweak'>Combined "Join as Larva" and "Join as Alien" into one verb: "Join as Xeno".</li>
        <li class='tweak'>Reduced maximum rejoin time from from 20 minutes to 10 minutes and reduced the minimum from 10 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Explanation: If you die in any form (or join as an Observer), you must wait for a 5 minute "death timer" (reduced from 10) before respawning as a Xeno. If a Xeno player leaves a living body (disconnect, ghost, etc), that body will begin an "away timer" for 5 minutes (also reduced from 10) before it is available for observers to join (they might reconnect). Therefore, the minimum and maximum time needed to wait before rejoining as an available Xeno is 5-10 minutes.
        <li class='rscadd'>Reminder for Admins: Spawned Larva using the Game Panel will immediately be ready for any observer to enter them (so long as their death timer is 5+ minutes). This can be useful for events and rewards for the Xeno team.</li>

If the game has rolled a Predator round, currently you can click Join the Hunt, and if you are whitelisted you can join even if you observe after round start (previously it would only enlist you when readied up). Good way of knowing if you are whitelisted! Most weapons and items have been tweaked or rebalanced.</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>Supply packs from cargo a bit different. Some contain different and new attachables. Ditto for attachables vendor. The new attachables are the Burst Fire Assembly and Magnetic Harness. Yay!</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Boilers buffed->neurotoxin smoke has more effect, plasma regen increased, acid spit cooldown lowered.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Hopefully Crusher momentum issues are fixed. You'll see different effects on slamming into things now. Not as much skidding around.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Some xeno plasma regen rates increased. Spitter movement speed increased but plasma regen decreased.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Hopefully fixed a few issues with throwing and dropping guns, and some item duplication glitches. If you abuse these kinds of bugged you will be perma banned guys. Don't risk it, just PM us.</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>Tons of Predator changes! Yay! If you are whitelisted you will get a special couple of buttons in your preferences page. Lots of Predator rebalances and tweaks.      XENOS: HERE IS WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT PREDATORS: You usually call them the HEAD TAKERS, or the invisible ones, or something along those lines. Yautja is also acceptable. You know they are dangerous but you aren't mindlessly attracted to killing them -- ask the Queen what to do when you see one. MARINES: HERE IS WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT PREDATORS: NOTHING. Probably hostile!</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Many automatic weapons now have a BURST FIRE feature! Massive risk of friendly fire ahoy! Use your weapon pane to activate it and watch as bullets spray wildly everywhere forever. I love this game.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Many guns are no longer holsterable. This includes the M92, SADAR, M42C, etc.</li>

		<li class='tweak'>Facehuggers now do an initial target scan when born</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Hivelords now get a new toggleable self-buff: "Resin Walker". This allows them to use weeds as a quick pathway to various places. When active it drains plasma quickly, but allows the hivelord to move very fast on weeds.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Many xeno caste speeds tweaked slightly. Most obvious is Boiler and Queen buffed.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Some xeno claw damages tweaked. Crusher claw damage increased a bit.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Several mercenary team weapons altered. MAR-40 significantly buffed.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Two new attachables! Sorry, they aren't available for use JUST yet. Expect them soon. They are: the magnetic harness, a rail-mounted accessory that snaps a weapon to your armor when dropped, and the burst fire assembly, an upgrade to your weapon's burst fire ability (or MAKES it burst fire if it wasn't)</li>

Resets to 0 when the mob's client is not null. E.g., away_timer = 127 means the client has been null for 127 seconds. Note: The original client might still be in-game as a ghost or cloned into a different body - just THAT mob has not had a client controlling it for [away_timer] seconds.</li>

		<li class='tweak'>Sniper rifle bullets do less damage to compensate for the new incendiary fire.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Four new weapon attachments, available in the crates and vendors: extended barrel (increases accuracy, reduces damage), barrel charger (greatly increases damage and reduces accuracy, increases recoil), quickfire adapter (increases firing rate, reduces accuracy) and recoil compensator (reduces recoil, reduces damage, increases accuracy). The first two can be used on a wide variety of guns, quickfire can go on M41, M39, M4A3, and 44 magnum, compensator can go on M37 and M42C.
