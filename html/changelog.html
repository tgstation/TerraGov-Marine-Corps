				<li class="rscadd">Pouch-like quickdraw functionality added to webbings.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Sniper gains the ability to use a laser aim mode while zoomed in with his sniper rifle. Toggle between laser aim and standard mode using Unique Action. While in laser mode, click a target to mark it with your laser; the target remains marked until you leave zoom or the target leaves your sight. You will be ready to fire immediately after marking a target. While you have a marked target, your shots will receive a significant boost in accuracy, ignore all other mobs and deal 50% bonus damage and pen to the marked target.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Sniper also gets tactical binos instead of standard binos, and 4 cloak grenades.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Guns now have their own zoom proc so that scopes can properly modify accuracy while zoomed.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Hyposprays can now flush reagents, draw reagents and inject reagents into non-mob reagent containers.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Cloak grenades added to the Sniper kit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Sniper now has the M68-B Thermal Cloak variant. This can only be worn with the M3 Recon armor, and provides superior stationary invisibility (including increased transparency when shimmering due to shooting/hostile actions) at the cost of all mobile transparency.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes the cooldown for the neurotox sting.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes plasma cost being improperly deducted on middle click selection.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">New buildable obstacle made using 4 metal rods and 1 length of barbed wire.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Up to 20 razorwire assemblies per stack; assemblies can fit in the technician's backpack.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">3 seconds to set up (-0.5 sec + -0.2 per rank of engi skill), 5 seconds to disassemble with wire cutters (-0.5 sec + -0.5 per rank of engi skill). 8 seconds to repair with welder (-1 sec + -0.5 per rank of engi skill).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blocks movement, but not projectiles, and things that can pass through grilles.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Attacking the razorwire in melee results in damage that is reduced by armour.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Climbing/pouncing into the razorwire results in significant damage and getting entangled for 5 seconds, as well as an initial slowdown and additional damage on disentangling.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Crushers can smash through the razorwire and avoid entanglement but only if they hit it at maximum speed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Boiler acid damages the razorwire.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">ZX-76 shotgun scout subkit added. This has a 10 round semi-auto shotgun with a double shot 'burst' in lieu of a battle rifle, and gets 2 boxes of incendiary shells for special ammo. Only one scout kit may still be selected.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Extended Barrel and RDS made slightly better for unwielded weapons. EB very slightly increases projectile speed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Suppressor very slightly decreases projectile speed, but its accuracy bonus has slightly increased for wielded and unwielded weapons.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Barrel Charger slightly increases projectile speed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Accuracy penalties for BFA, wielded and unwielded, slightly reduced.</li>
				<li class="tweak">M41A MK2 can now attach a recoil compensator.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Extra buckshot spread reduced; max range increased to 10 tiles. This should make investing in buckshot accuracy worth a damn as it can be at least somewhat effective out to mid range now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Flechette spread slightly reduced as values were higher than intended per spread inherent to the shotgun.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Supply packs updated: orders of 2x standard guns now come with 2 AP mags of the appropriate type. 1x HPR + ammo cost reduced to 20 points, and valu pack of 5 HPR + ammo costs 80 points.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Neurotoxin projectile fire delays increased by +0.5 seconds across the board and progression smoothed out. Max range decreased to 10 tiles down from 15, and accurate range threshold decreased to 5 tiles down from 15, reducing its ability to off-screen; should still be very consistent at mid range.</li>
