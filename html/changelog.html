		<li class='rscadd'>Weapon attachments can now be reloaded. The masterkey shotgun needs shotgun buckshot, the underslug grenade launcher needs M40 HEDP grenades, and the mini flamethrower needs  a flamethrower tank.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Using those attachment is no longer 'single use', i.e. if you fire the mini flamethrower once you're no longer automatically switched back to the main weapon. However if the attachment is empty and you try to use it you're automatically switched back to the main gun.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>To reload those attachments: if detached you simply click it with the appropriate ammo, if attached to enable the attachment and click the gun with the ammo. Beware: you can no longer reload the primary gun with those attachments toggled on. You can now see exactly how much ammo is left in the attachment by examining the gun it's attached to.</li>

	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>Various sound-related verbs in the Preferences (everyone) and Fun (Admins only) tabs have been improved:</li>
		<li><u>For all players</u> - Admin midis can still be permanently turned on/off via the Character Setup screen (or in Ghost > Edit Characters if you're observing). However, if you have admin midis enabled and an Admin plays a sound, you can use the new <b>Silence Current Midi</b> verb in the Preferences tab to forcibly stop hearing it. Additionally, a message is sent to staff when a player uses this verb within 30 seconds of a midi playing, letting us know that a player has silenced it. This is to give us a better idea of which sounds/midis are favorable over others. The goal is to improve immersion by teaching staff to play immersive, favorable songs and sounds while the game is played. For this reason, we're hoping those of you with Admin midis turned off will now turn them on in your Character Setup screen in order to take part.</li>
		<li><u>For Staff with the Fun tab</u> - "Play Global Sound" and "Play Local Sound" have been replaced by <b>Play Imported Sound</b> and <b>Play Sound From List</b>. The former will allow importing any sound from anywhere on your computer and then tells all connected clients to download and then play it (the way "Play Global Sound" used to work). The latter will display a list of server sounds and music that are already in the project and do not need to be downloaded by anyone. Obviously, "Play Sound From List" is preferred, and this can and will grow as we add more immersive music to the project (within reason - we don't want gigabytes worth of music). Both verbs now have "Global" or "Local" as secondary options when playing a sound, and both will show how many players are hearing it.</li>
		<li class='soundadd'>Also, Power Loader footstep sounds are now much more accurate.</li>

The target must be in open ground, just like the orbital beacon. The laser takes a few second to appear and will disappear if the SL does not stand still. Target lasers will automatically disappear after 60 seconds. Pilots can now choose between two flight types: * TRANSPORT which is the one everyone knows, that moves between the Almayer and the ground planet, and * FIRE MISSION which allows you to detect laser targets on the ground and fire the dropship weapons at those targets, the dropship lands back where it started.

		<li class='tweak'>False walls have been restored, along with everything associated with girders - metal needed returned to 2, time to build a wall returned to 8. Thanks for the constructive criticism (http://www.colonial-marines.com/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=12048). We'll look into some good alternatives and in the future disable false walls at the same time as having a good replacement.</li>

	<h3 class='author'>Rahlzel updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='tweak'>When players come to a locked airlock, most of the time they'll just deconstruct the wall beside it since the airlock itself takes some time to hack and deconstructing the wall only takes 2 quick steps - welder and wrench. We're changing this to be more in line with realism and, as a bonus, making Squad Engineers more useful as airlock hackers. As a result several things have changed:</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Normal (non-reinforced) walls now take 7 steps to deconstruct them instead of 2. Deconstruction starts the same way - with a lit welder - and the wall can be examined during the entire process to visually see which tool needs to be used next to continue. This will help prevent wiki-checking during normal gameplay. Also note that damaged walls must be repaired first (also with a welder) before they can be neatly deconstructed. This will all happen automagically just by hitting a wall with a lit welder - it will either start repair or start deconstruction.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Wall building/construction has been made a bit tougher in order to balance the realism of it now taking longer to deconstruct a wall. Walls now use 5 metal sheets on a girder instead of 2, and the time it takes to finish construction has been increased from 8 seconds to 30 seconds.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>False walls have been removed. We debated this to some extent and ultimately came to the conclusion that an entire wall sliding in and out is not exactly canon or even realistic (it's also simply old Baycode that we just haven't dealt with yet). We are considering alternatives, however, such as a barricade "gate" that slides open and closed, or allowing marines to be more nimble by jumping over any barricade (including flipped ones) after a brief cooldown.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Unrelated, but noteworthy: The Chem Dispenser's access requirements are now working correctly, which means that Squad Medics no longer have access to them. The Chemist/Doctor/Researcher/CMO watching his or her Chem Dispenser getting raided each round can now feel useful again.</li>
		<li>Thanks to forwardslashN for assistance with the above, and to Artouris for the April Fools update yesterday. The ocean-biomed "Nostromo" and "Old Sulaco" maps were quite popular, so we'll keep them and run them once in a while for fun and nostalgia. For those new to the community, they are based on our original 2 maps that were our first ones several years ago. You can read more about them here: http://www.colonial-marines.com/wiki/History#Pre-Alpha_Maps</li>

It is not possible to change what access a weapon will require, nor is it possible to add anything other than the marine identification access through the identification console.

In the meantime, the cave areas in the current LV-624 have been fully furnished with dozens more resin nodes, resin doors, and nest areas to help starting Xeno teams defend somewhat comfortably immediately when the round starts.</li>
		<li>In other news, a fixed version of Ice Colony will be arriving soon(TM), perhaps within a week or two. We recognize that one of our biggest issues right now is the need for a change of scenery with new maps and an easy way for players to choose them, so those are near the top of our list.</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>The "bioscans" that Admins commonly give out have now been automated. They first arrive after 1 hour and repeat every 30 minutes. The Xenos receive a similar message from the <a href='http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/Queen_Mother'>Queen Mother</a>, which in Alien lore is an extremely powerful Xeno that ranks above all Queens and Empresses with enough telepathic power to reach across entire galaxies. The more you know. For marines, the bioscan of the ship is exact, but for the planet and elsewhere it's slightly inaccurate. For Xenos, the Queen Mother message for the planet is exact, but for the "metal hive" and elsewhere it's slightly inaccurate. We feel this change will help against long, drawn-out rounds when one side camps even though there's only a few enemies left because they don't know how many enemies there are.

	</ul>
	<h3 class='author'>forwardslashN updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed incorrect damage calculations on armor... What this means: armor will generally protect you a little better from FF and  other firearm related injury. It will also have a far higher chance of negating small arms fire (handguns/SMGs) the majority of  the time. Rifles and the like will still make you hurt, a lot. </li>
		<li class='wip'>Important: might be an issue with twohanding a gun, report any weird behavior asap so I can fix it!</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed xeno spits not messaging what they are when hitting marines.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed some issues related to the ammo displaying caliber incorrectly.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed bullets flying away after hitting a hugger.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed the heavy pulse rifle not having an ammo counter.</li>

		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed flashlight light-related bugs with guns.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed some missing back icons for guns and some other items. As well as some misc things.</li>

		<li class='bugfix'>Some misc gun fixes and consistency tweaks.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed sadar speed calculations.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>A bunch of efficiency changes related to the gun system. Probably won't be noticable too much in general, but will be noticable  during heavy firefights. It's pretty much as lag free at this point as it gets. Hopefully.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>I rewrote bipods since their functions were disabled with the gun update. They will work as follows: You activate attachment if  you want to get into a position to use the bipod. If it finds something, you will get a message. If you are already in a position  to shoot and keep that position, or it doesn't find anything, it will instead activate your other attachments. When you shoot and  you are not in the right position, the bipod will "deactivate" automatically and you can try and get into a new position. You have  to be facing the same way as you did when you established a position for the bipod, among other things. It should be fairly  logical. Bipods work with tables, racks, and metal barricades, though there may be a few others I'm not aware of. Should work fine  regardless. Bipods no longer provide bonuses at all unless they are used in a position, but firing them in position is very  beneficial.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked buckshot.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked slug speed.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked sniper bullet speed.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked some distress equipment spawns.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked predator storage slots.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Rockets changed again. Explosive rockets will always explode on the tile of the clicked target. AP and WP rockets will always fly  straight unless shooting a downed person or some such. AP and WP rockets must hit the target to do any real damage.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Silencers will now give a different firing sound and hide muzzle flash. They now decrease damage a tad, but give increased  accuracy and less recoil. Not as great as recoil comp/extended though.</li>

Defibs are considered to be quite overpowered, so there is a limit to their usage (about 10 uses per defib - some of which will fail). Also, they cannot be recharged, so the ones you start with are all you have. However, we're still open to discussion regarding them and anything else on our forum.

		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed guns giving a ton of error messages while wielded and then E'd to equip.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed xeno not properly doing burn damage.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed guns and ammo not having research levels set. They're all proper now.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed shotguns breaking on point blank.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed an issue with xeno spits barely doing any damage to turrets.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed guns firing on burst when dropped.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed issues with suicide with a gun and point blanking.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed/rewrote point blanking. Aside from not breaking anymore, it also takes into account all bonuses and never misses.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed rockets going into pockets/belts... Also fixed rocket launchers not taking the right ammo.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed sadars being able to fire on the Sully.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed tasers not going into charging ports. You can recharge them proper now.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed wooden barricades not being damaged by bullets or other projectiles.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed, I hope, preds not gibbing on death.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed buckshot hitting you, the shooter, when close enough.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed closet health and them getting destroyed with any sort of projectile. Like a taser.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed rockets going into belts and such.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Regular magazine-fed guns now chamber rounds as they do in real life (those that actually do that). This change won't effect much, but you can now fire  off a mag and still have a bullet to fire in the chamber. Or reload with the chambered round. Every time you reload a mag, you  will cock the weapon if there's nothing chambered.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Attachments that you can fire will now tell you if they are empty or not.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>If you only have one attachment that can activate on your gun (ie, launcher/scope), you will auto select it istead of a menu.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Masterkey shotgun and any future attachables that use bullets can now make casings (if they are not caseless). You can also attach it to the pump shotty.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>You can now suicide with attachables, if they shoot bullets. Specifically the masterkey, but it also applies to anything else that is added in the future.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Masterkey shotgun now has 5 shots instead of 4.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Attached flamers now have a range of 5 tiles instead of 2.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Stocks now fit the A/2 rifle. No reason they shouldn't. Takes the same attachments as the regular MK2.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Elite M39s now take the same attachments as the regular version. Same reason.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Shotguns now have 25 shells per box, enough for five handfuls. There are also less boxes per vendor. All shotguns will accept handfuls of ammo, so it doesn't matter what box you got it from (keep clicking on the shotgun to reload shell by shell). You can also load different types of ammo into the shotgun, and it will fire them in sequence, starting with the last loaded.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Shotguns adjusted. Slugs behave like regular bullets, but do more damage (they had damage fallout before, losing damage as they  travelled) with good armor penetration. Buckshot has very short range, but it does massive damage up-close, and quickly loses  damage the more it travels.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Revolvers behave differently. You won't eject the mag when you run out of bullets. You will instead eject all the spent casings  and any bullets you have not fired (in the form of a handful) once you manually empty the gun. Once the revolver is empty, you may  reload it with a speedloader. You may instead reload it the revolver with a handful of ammo. You can also click a speedloader with  an empty hand to make a handful of ammo out of it. You may instead click a speedloader with a handful of ammo to reload it. You  can transfer ammo between handfuls of the same type, but you cannot mix them together for the sake of sanity. Unload (or click the  revolver with itself) to close the cylinder and fire. You can also spin the cylinder with use unique action if you want to play  Russian Roulette.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>All revolvers now fit the belt.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Smartgun will attempt to auto-reload roughly every 20 bullets fired. Any time you try to reload manually, this number will be  reset. If you stand still, you can constinuously fire until you run dry.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Smartgun now has a safety feature. Altclick it to toggle shooting any targets in your way or ignoring friendlies.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Renamed the M41A to M41A MK2. Just a cosmetic difference.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>The Russian variant of the Korovin can take the same attachments and both are properly silenced.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Some misc changes to a few guns in terms of attachments.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Guns now don't immediately tell you how much ammo they have upon examine unless they have an ammo counter, like the pulse rifle.  Smartguns are exempt.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Added two new guns that are inaccesible for now.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>The replica katana is now a real weapon that is okay for real combat. Beware the samurai.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Finished implementing spent casings for guns that use them. This won't impact 95% of the game, but cool to have when the Bears  show up.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Minigun fixed and made significantly stronger. You have been warned.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Adjusted the muzzle flash to be a bit offset, to make it better looking.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Some guns won't automatically eject the mag. Mostly shotguns, revolvers, and a few misc guns not commonly available to marines.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Nerfed the merc shotgun to burstfire less.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Removed Russian guns from RO. Turns out you weren't supposed to have access to them.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Autolathes won't eat material for regular stacks of metal/glass. So you'll get the same number of mats back if you try to print  sheets.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>You can now burst fire right after reloading. You can also shoot grenades/flame/masterkey while the gun is empty or after  reloading.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>You can unload two handed weapons by holding them in your inactive hand then clicking them with your active hand. You'll take out  the mag.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Small predator weapon change.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Predators can shoot while cloaked. This is meant to incite terror and ward off enemies. Not to kill. If you abuse this, you will be removed.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Added muzzle flash to turrets.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Updated UI icons for various gun switches and added a new one. It's called Use Unique Action and it will allow you to pump  shotguns instead of the pump shotgun verb, along with other gun specific unique actions.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Added a scope category to attachable vendor. It starts with zero, but can be restocked.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Load bearing equipment now has 4 slots instead of 3.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Some guns can no longer point blank. Mostly snipers/smartgun/a few others. If they're really big or energy based, don't expect  them to point blank.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Added safety toggle to guns. alt+click to toggle it on or off. Default is off.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>The taser has 10 shots now, instead of near infinite shots (500).</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Adjusted tables to take more damage from bullets.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Adjusted plasma caster projectile speeds.</li>
		<li class='soundadd'>Added some new weapon sounds courtesy of Rahlzel, including some new attachable sounds.</li>
		<li class='wip'>Handfuls and bullet casings may change icon when thrown. I am working on a fix, so try not to throw them around.</li>
		<li class='wip'>Sadars may puff in strange and unexpected directions. Working on a fix.</li>
		<li class='wip'>Bipods DO NOT WORK. They still provide static bonuses, but their code to use barricades DOES NOT WORK. I will enable it when I find a good solution.</li>
		<li class='wip'>Guns do not have a back icon when empty. Some guns do not have a back icon at all. Will fix asap.</li>
		<li class='wip'>Some muzzle flashes and pings are missing. Will provide them when possible.</li>
		<li class='wip'>There is a runtime in targeting. Investigating it soon.</li>
		<li class='wip'>Bullets appearing underneath characters when fired, though you may not see it all the time.. Will fix soon.</li>
		<li class='wip'>Report anything else that comes up on the forums.</li>

		<li class='bugfix'>Hopefully fire bug fixed with humans and xenos, from incendiary rounds. Hopefully.</li>

		<li class='bugfix'>Predators are no longer slowed down by cold, and their armor protects them better.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Aliens can no longer drag items. What you say! What! Holy moly! Yes, it's a big change. No dragging flares, lockers, facehuggers, etc. You can still drag mobs. MANY objects have been tweaked and changed slightly to ensure things remain fair for them -- draggable objects are all destroyable (such as vending machines) and some are no longer dense. You can no longer build some structures with metal, such as closets, and all lockers are now bolted to the ground. </li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Didn't think I was giving that away for free, did you? Most non-runner-caste xenos now get access to the Secure Host verb in aliens tab, which lets you spin resin on a nested host to secure them first with handcuffs, and then legcuffs which must be resisted out of to get free.</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>Holy crap new projectile system! You actually have to aim now. Learn firing angles. Practice! You'll find all kinds of new guns, the pathfinding is much better, the system doesn't lag us out. Wow! See the forums for a bunch of posts about it. New ammo! New attachables! Holy shit! Someone should write a guide so I can belittle its ignorance.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Hunter Games gamemode! Yay! This is something we bring out once in a while to keep things fresh and let people blow off a little bit of steam. Might be a good idea to keep a no-name character handy to play there. Like the gamemode? Don't like it? Voice your opinions on the forum! The way Hunter Games works is, you ready up, get spawned into LV624 amidst a huge pile of random stuff. Then you fight it out until there's only one left standing! The last survivor has their name kept in the server logs forever. Glory!</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Xeno HP has been nerfed slightly across the board. Some castes have had armor values increased to compensate, some had no HP nerf, and some got double whammied. Expect balance to be tweaked until I'm satisfied we can get maximum bloodshed from both teams. And don't fret, coming up next is the big xeno rewrite..</li>

		<li>Observer improvements in "Ghost" tab:</li>
        <li class='rscadd'>New verb: Follow Xeno. Shows a list of living Xenos that are playing.</li>
        <li class='tweak'>Combined "Join as Larva" and "Join as Alien" into one verb: "Join as Xeno".</li>
        <li class='tweak'>Reduced maximum rejoin time from from 20 minutes to 10 minutes and reduced the minimum from 10 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Explanation: If you die in any form (or join as an Observer), you must wait for a 5 minute "death timer" (reduced from 10) before respawning as a Xeno. If a Xeno player leaves a living body (disconnect, ghost, etc), that body will begin an "away timer" for 5 minutes (also reduced from 10) before it is available for observers to join (they might reconnect). Therefore, the minimum and maximum time needed to wait before rejoining as an available Xeno is 5-10 minutes.
        <li class='rscadd'>Reminder for Admins: Spawned Larva using the Game Panel will immediately be ready for any observer to enter them (so long as their death timer is 5+ minutes). This can be useful for events and rewards for the Xeno team.</li>

		<li class='bugfix'>Hopefully most if not all of the Predator bugs have been fixed. If the game has rolled a Predator round, currently you can click Join the Hunt, and if you are whitelisted you can join even if you observe after round start (previously it would only enlist you when readied up). Good way of knowing if you are whitelisted! Most weapons and items have been tweaked or rebalanced.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>M56 goggles hopefully re-added to smartgun pack</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>You will no longer accumulate royal jelly when SSD.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Xenos now damage animals using proper damage based on caste.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Beam attacks now damage sentry turrets (I'm looking at you, yautja caster & spitter spit)</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Hopefully a bunch of bugs with hellhounds & smart-discs fixed. Stop asking about them!</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Supply packs from cargo a bit different. Some contain different and new attachables. Ditto for attachables vendor. The new attachables are the Burst Fire Assembly and Magnetic Harness. Yay!</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Boilers buffed->neurotoxin smoke has more effect, plasma regen increased, acid spit cooldown lowered.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Hopefully Crusher momentum issues are fixed. You'll see different effects on slamming into things now. Not as much skidding around.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Some xeno plasma regen rates increased. Spitter movement speed increased but plasma regen decreased.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Hopefully fixed a few issues with throwing and dropping guns, and some item duplication glitches. If you abuse these kinds of bugged you will be perma banned guys. Don't risk it, just PM us.</li>

		<li class='tweak'>In the interest of balance and variety, The Nexus building has been reworked to be much easier for Xenos to infiltrate. More breaches, a simple vent system, etc. But, it's still close to the LZ.</li>
        <li class='tweak'>The Lv-624 Medbay has been made more appealing as a FOB with a more open area, closed off potential breaches, surgery room, supplies, and metal/plasteel nearby. But, it's further away from the LZ than the Nexus. Which will you choose?</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>Tons of Predator changes! Yay! If you are whitelisted you will get a special couple of buttons in your preferences page. Lots of Predator rebalances and tweaks.      XENOS: HERE IS WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT PREDATORS: You usually call them the HEAD TAKERS, or the invisible ones, or something along those lines. Yautja is also acceptable. You know they are dangerous but you aren't mindlessly attracted to killing them -- ask the Queen what to do when you see one. MARINES: HERE IS WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT PREDATORS: NOTHING. Probably hostile!</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Many automatic weapons now have a BURST FIRE feature! Massive risk of friendly fire ahoy! Use your weapon pane to activate it and watch as bullets spray wildly everywhere forever. I love this game.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Many guns are no longer holsterable. This includes the M92, SADAR, M42C, etc.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Can no longer drop/throw the wielded symbol. Hopefully. Stop duping weapons, you shits!</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Facehuggers now do an initial target scan when born</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Hivelords now get a new toggleable self-buff: "Resin Walker". This allows them to use weeds as a quick pathway to various places. When active it drains plasma quickly, but allows the hivelord to move very fast on weeds.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Many xeno caste speeds tweaked slightly. Most obvious is Boiler and Queen buffed.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Some xeno claw damages tweaked. Crusher claw damage increased a bit.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Several mercenary team weapons altered. MAR-40 significantly buffed.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Two new attachables! Sorry, they aren't available for use JUST yet. Expect them soon. They are: the magnetic harness, a rail-mounted accessory that snaps a weapon to your armor when dropped, and the burst fire assembly, an upgrade to your weapon's burst fire ability (or MAKES it burst fire if it wasn't)</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Probably some other minor stuff I'm forgetting.</li>

Ghosts who are around when it is called can use Join Response Team to join it, but you have to be ghosted for a certain amount of time.

		<li class='tweak'>Players will no longer be forced into a chestbursting Xeno larva. If you have your preference to be a Xeno turned off, the only time you might be a Xeno is if the gamemode forces you to be one at round-start because it didn't find enough Xeno players. In order to become a Xeno after the round starts, you must have your Xeno candidacy enabled. This can be done at round-start by setting "Be Xeno" to "Yes", or by using Preferences > Toggle SpecialRole Candidacy > Xenomorph to "ON".</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>...However, infected hosts who have their Xeno candidacy turned OFF and there are no observer candidates to take control of the chestbursting larva (thus causing the host to stall chestbursting) will have a new challenge to contend with while the fully-grown larva sits in their chest cavity.</li>

		<li class='tweak'>Pheromones! Drones, carriers, hivelords, praetorians, and Queens now have the ability to emit specific types of pheromones -- frenzy, guard, and recovery. Any xeno in range is affected by the pheromones automatically; it drains plasma to use but doesn't negate plasma regen entirely.

		<li class='tweak'>Communications Console update (the computer that calls the shuttle):</li>
		<li>"Call Emergency Shuttle" is only available when USCM is offline (no Admins are present), 1 hour has passed, and there are more Xenos than 80% of humans (to account for some non-combat jobs such as Maintenance Tech).</li>
		<li>If Admins are present, only "Request Emergency Shuttle" is available (assuming the above checks are true).</li>
		<li>Both Mods and Admins can see shuttle requests and USCM messages from players and Mark/Respond to them, and other Admins/Mods can see that Admin's response.</li>
		<li>Xenos are mass-notified when the shuttle is called to facilitate the already-existing (but acceptable) potential for metagaming due to this pivotal point in the round that will cause them to win or lose.</li>
