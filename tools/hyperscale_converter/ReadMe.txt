This tool is to help divide sprites up to be used for the hyperscale system.
This splits greyscale sprites into many icons, based on their grayscale value.
A greyscale sprite with three colors will be split into three sprites, one with two will be split into two, etc.
The original file will not be altered.

Directions:
Run converter.py,
Type the relative directory of the greyscale to be converted. (This is relative to the file under the TGMC directory)
Hit enter and let the script run.
The script will save the new sprites into the /output folder.
