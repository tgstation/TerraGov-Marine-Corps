# HSLify

This is a simple Python script that converts all hex colors in a directory to their corresponding HSL values.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install colormath
```

2. Move files so that hslify is in the same directory as the files you want to process. That can be in this folder, or by moving this folder to the same directory as the files you want to process.

3. Run the script:

```bash
py hslify.py
```

4. Formatting is strange, so it may be necessary to save the file manually for prettier to format it.
