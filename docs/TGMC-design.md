## About

The point of this document is to outline the server's current and future intended design. The future design section will be at the end and is likely to change greatly over time, whilst the current design will be a much slower changing and will serve as a useful overview for new players and code contributors to understand the differences between the factions.

The main USP of TGMC is: “asymmetrical team deathmatch PvP gameplay with a high degree of QoL”.

## Current Design

### Visual

- Xenomorphs - arachnid mixed with dinosaurs.
- TG Marines - highly flamboyant armour design and accessorising, or dressed in regular military attire if preferred. Ballistic, incendiary and explosive weaponry with a modern design, as well as futuristic laser weaponry.
- Sons of Mars - orange mirrored helmets, dark orange accent colour on black clothing. High-tech volkite weaponry.

### Gameplay

The two main factions Xenomorphs and TG Marines have assymetrical combat. This means whilst there may be a few distinct exceptions in their gameplay, they each have unique strengths compared to each other, as well as some similarities.

#### Xenomorphs

**Strengths**
- More suited to hit-and-run attacks, due to their better information gathering (X-ray and darkvision) and high movement speed (especially on weeds).
- Combat castes are well-suited to go deep behind enemy lines to pick off stragglers.
- Excels in caves as this prevents Orbital Strikes, Close Air Support and the Tadpole.
- Reliable combat engagement tools (e.g. Queen Screech, King Scattering Roar) for initiating team fights.
- Respawn timer is much shorter than marines. However marines *can* recover their dead bodies to revive those, reducing their respawn time.
- No resources to manage to continue successful heavy combat.
	- Marines on the other hand are dependent on ammo and equipment supplies. They have to co-ordinate with others to resupply after sustained combat.

#### TG Marines

**Strengths**
- Better suited to defend areas thanks to barricades, razorfoam, automated turrets and machine gun emplacements.
- Well-suited to siege areas thanks to Orbital Strikes, Close Air Support, explosives and incendiary weaponry. Xenos on the other hand ar
- Excels in corridors as it means less directions they can be attacked from, and a better chance of getting shots on-target.
- In melee range are generally weaker as xenos have faster movement speed for dodging. Exceptions are [Vali](https://tgstation13.org/wiki/TGMC:Guide_to_Vali) and point-blank shotguns blasts.
- If their dead bodies can be recovered, they can be revived
- Less dependent on unique roles staying alive. Only a few medics, engineers and a pilot are needed, the rest being marines can work just fine.
	- Xenos on the other hand are dependent on a variety of castes staying alive. Drone tree for construction, Sentinel tree for ranged capabilities, Runner and Defender trees for close quarters combat, plus Rulers for pheromones.
- Less dependent on individual player skill. As there are much more marines than xenos, unless they sabotage the group then skilled players can average out the less skilled ones.
	- Xenos on the other hand depend on skilled players as there are much less of them, especially for the ruler roles.

#### Similarities

- Both have mechanics intended to reduce their individual effectiveness if they take heavy damage during sustained combat (sunder for xenos, fractures for marines).
- Both have snowball mechanics (they get stronger over the course of the round if they're winning). Maturity and structures for xenos, req points for marines.
- Neither have catch-up mechanics (getting stronger if losing).
