As a ravager, anytime you take damage you get even more angry, and thus resist more damage.
As the Queen, you contain the hivemind of all the xenos.
As a boiler, you have the most powerful corrosive acid for melting things.
As a hunter, you have almost perfect stealth if you stand still.
As a drone, your corrosive acid is very weak, but it's better than nothing.
As a larva, ask your queen what you should evolve into.
