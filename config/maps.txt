map lv624
	default
	announcetext A faint distress signal has been picked up by our scanners, which have tracked the source to a third generation colony, known as LV-624. Through use of bluespace drive tech, the ###SHIPNAME### has jumped within range of the colony. TGMC, gear up and get ready to respond!
endmap

map bigred_v2
	announcetext A second generation colony has had a beacon transmitting the same signal, nonstop. Attempts to hail the colony over comms have proved futile. Because the ###SHIPNAME### was at a nearby drydock, it has been dispatched to figure out what's wrong. TGMC, prepare to deploy!
endmap

map ice_colony_v2
	announcetext A garbled, unintelligible communications message was broadcasted over a general frequency, and picked up by our comms relay. The message appears to have come from a second generation settlement, located on an ice cold planet. The ###SHIPNAME### is moving into the sector with thrusters at max throttle. TGMC, get briefed and then move out!
endmap

map prison_station_fop
	announcetext A Nanotrasen maximum security prison has activated its distress signal. The ###SHIPNAME### is swiftly cruising through space, and nearing the vicinity of the prison station. TGMC, get moving!
