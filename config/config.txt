## This should be disabled (through `CACHE_ASSETS 0`) on development,
## but enabled on production (the default).
CACHE_ASSETS 0

## If this is uncommented, we will save all associated spritesheet PNGs and CSS files to a folder in the round-specific logs folder.
## Useful for developers to debug potential spritesheet issues to determine where the issue is cropping up (either in DM-side sprite generation or in the TGUI-side display of said spritesheet).
## Will only seek to waste disk space if ran on production.
