## %minutes% is replaced with PANIC_BUNKER_LIVING on runtime, remove it if you don't want this
#PANIC_BUNKER_MESSAGE Sorry, but the server is currently not accepting connections from players with less than %minutes% minutes of living time.

## If panic bunker is on and a player is rejected (see above), attempt to send them to this connected server (see below) instead.

#PANIC_SERVER_ADDRESS byond://address:port

##Name of the place to send people rejected by the bunker
#PANIC_SERVER_NAME [Put the name here]

## Notify admins when a new player connects for the first x days a player's been around. (0 for first connection only, -1 for never)

##Default view size, in tiles.
##	By default, this is 15x15, which gets simplified to 7 by byond
##  15x15 would be the standard square view. 21x15 is what goonstation uses for widescreen.
##  Setting this to something different from DEFAULT_VIEW_SQUARE will enable widescreen toggles
##	Do note that changing this value will affect the title screen. The title screen will have to be updated manually if this is changed.
DEFAULT_VIEW 19x15

##Default view size, in tiles. Should *always* be square.
## The alternative square viewport size if you're using a widescreen view size
## You probably shouldn't ever be changing this, but it's here if you want to.
DEFAULT_VIEW_SQUARE 15x15
