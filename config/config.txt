## Server name: This appears at the top of the screen in-game. In this case it will read "tgstation: station_name" where station_name is the randomly generated name of the station for the round. Remove the # infront of SERVERNAME and replace 'tgstation' with the name of your choice
# SERVERNAME spacestation13

## Alert levels
ALERT_GREEN All threats to the station have passed. Security may not have weapons visible, privacy laws are once again fully enforced.
ALERT_BLUE_UPTO The station has received reliable information about possible hostile activity on the station. Security staff may have weapons visible, random searches are permitted.
ALERT_BLUE_DOWNTO The immediate threat has passed. Security may no longer have weapons drawn at all times, but may continue to have them visible. Random searches are still allowed.
ALERT_RED_UPTO There is an immediate serious threat to the station. Security may have weapons unholstered at all times. Random searches are allowed and advised.
ALERT_RED_DOWNTO The self-destruct mechanism has been deactivated, there is still however an immediate serious threat to the station. Security may have weapons unholstered at all times, random searches are allowed and advised.
ALERT_DELTA The station's self-destruct mechanism has been engaged. All crew are instructed to obey all instructions given by heads of staff. Any violations of these orders can be punished by death. This is not a drill.

## Add a # here if you wish to use the setup where jobs have more access. This is intended for servers with low populations - where there are not enough players to fill all roles, so players need to do more than just one job. Also for servers where they don't want people to hide in their own departments.
JOBS_HAVE_MINIMAL_ACCESS

## Unhash this entry to have certain jobs require your account to be at least a certain number of days old to select. You can configure the exact age requirement for different jobs by editing
## the minimal_player_age variable in the files in folder /code/game/jobs/job/.. for the job you want to edit. Set minimal_player_age to 0 to disable age requirement for that job.
## REQUIRES the database set up to work. Keep it hashed if you don't have a database set up.
## NOTE: If you have just set-up the database keep this DISABLED, as player age is determined from the first time they connect to the server with the database up. If you just set it up, it means
## you have noone older than 0 days, since noone has been logged yet. Only turn this on once you have had the database up for 30 days.
#USE_AGE_RESTRICTION_FOR_JOBS

##DAMAGE CALCULATION DEFINES
##If you are wondering what point these values have,
##they should also transfer over to various forms of combat.
##Assuming those forms of combat will exist in the future, but
##for right now they exist for shooting guns at things.

##Global settings for projectile damage and accuracy multiplication. Can increase or decrease it based on these numbers.
##This can be changed in the game, and is based off 1 instead of .01. It's just multiplied by .01 after the number is changed.
##So, 0.95 is less than 1.05. The latter will result in more damage/accuracy, the former in less.
PROJ_BASE_ACCURACY_MULT 0.01

##This is the lower boundry of a critical.
CRITICAL_CHANCE_LOW 5 
##This is the upper boundry of a critical.

### MOB MOVEMENT ###

## We suggest editing these variabled in-game to find a good speed for your server. To do this you must be a high level admin. Open the 'debug' tab ingame. Select "Debug Controller" and then, in the popup, select "Configuration". These variables should have the same name.

## These values get directly added to values and totals in-game. To speed things up make the number negative, to slow things down, make the number positive.


## These modify the run/walk speed of all mobs before the mob-specific modifiers are applied. 
RUN_SPEED 1
WALK_SPEED 1


## The variables below affect the movement of specific mob types.
HUMAN_DELAY 0
ROBOT_DELAY 0
MONKEY_DELAY 0
ALIEN_DELAY 0
METROID_DELAY 0
ANIMAL_DELAY 0
