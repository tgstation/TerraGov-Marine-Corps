Dying is part of the game.
Almost every specialist has been reworked.
You can select locations on the doll by using the number pad.
As a human, say '*medic' to call out for medical attention.
As a human, melee a person on fire with help intent to put the fire out.
As a human, use 'resist' to stop drop and roll when on fire.
Not being ready at the start of the round means xenos get more burrowed larva, and that you don't get to play as quickly.
Sometimes you won't be able to avoid dying no matter how good you are at the game. Try not to stress too much about it.
When a round ends nearly everything about it is lost forever, leave your salt behind with it.
Some people are unable to read text on a game where half of it is based on text.
It's fun to try and predict the round type from the tip of the round message.
This is a game that is constantly being developed for. Expect things to be added, removed, fixed, and broken on a daily basis.
